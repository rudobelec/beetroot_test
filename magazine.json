Introduction: Psoriasis is a multifaceted immune-mediated skin
disease and has been associated with other comorbidities. Previous
studies in psoriasis reported the abundance of microbial taxa above
the species rank (family Firmicutes and genus Staphylococcus),
or the combined abundance of multiple taxa (Corynebacterium,
Propionibacterium, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus) were
associated with psoriasis [1–3]. Characterizing the skin microbiome
of psoriasis subjects and family controls can further our
understanding of microbiota’s role in this disease.
Objectives: This study aims to reveal the difference of skin microbiome
between skin lesion area and normal area of the elbow
as well as family controls.
Methods: DNA samples was extracted from 21 elbow-skin. 14 of
21 were from 7 psoriasis subjects’ lesion side and normal side.
The rest were from a healthy family member whom the subject
lives with. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was adapted to
resolute the skin microbiota. Partially overlapping t-test was used
to investigate differentially abundant taxa. PERMANOVA was
used to test the difference of microbial community composition
influenced by psoriasis and sampling families.
Results: Bacteria phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes
were three most abundant microbial taxa in both lesion
and normal skin. Bacteria phyla Cyanobacteria and Candidatus
Parcubacteria, family Hymenobacteraceae were less abundant
on lesion skin than normal skin (p < 0.05). Sampling families
had significantly different elbow-skin microbial composition for
bacterial genus level profile (p = 0.001).
Conclusions: Several bacterial taxa different from those previously
discovered are more abundant on normal skin than lesion skin in
the elbow.

NAIL DISORDERS IN PATIENTS WITH PSORIASIS
VULGARIS
Jasmina Muhovic
University Clinical Centre Sarajevo
Introduction: Psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin
disease characterized by T-cell-mediated hyperpfoliferation of
keratinocytes in the skin. Approximately, 10–78% of patients
with psoriasis have concurrent nail psoriasis while isolated nail
involvement is seen in 5–10% of patients. Affected nail plates often
thicken and crumble and because they are very visible patients
tend to avoid normal day-to-day activities and social interactions.
Importantly, 70–80% of patients with psoriatic arthritis have nail
psoriasis. In this overview, we review the clinical manifestations
of psoriasis affecting the nails.
Objectives: To correlate frequency of certain nail dissorders
in patients with psoriasis vulgaris. The observed dissorders
were:onicholysis, subungual hyperkeratosis, oil spots, and pitting
in both male and female patients aged 15–75 and combined with
psoriatic arthritis.
Methods: A total of 60 patients who were treated in our Inpatients
Service with diagnosis of Psoriasis vulgaris from January 2017
to July 2017 at Dermatology Department, University Clinical of
Sarajevo.We searched for specific nail dissorders.
Results: A total number of 60 patients with Psoriasis vulgaris,
both male and female aged 15–75 werw examined. Out of that
number, 43 patients reported to have specific nail dissorders and/
or psoriatic arthritis, and 17 of them were without any nail dissorders
or psoriatic arthritis. Among the number of 43 examined
psoriatis patients with nail dissorders, there were 23 female and
20 male patients, all of them aged between 45–60. Seven female
and eight male patients had previously diagnosed psoriatic arthritis
combined with psoriasis and nail disorders, while the rest of them,
28 patients, only had psoriasis followed by progressive changes
on their nails, but without any signs of psoriatic arthritis. The
presented nail dissorders in all patients included in these two
groups were: subungual hyperkeratosis, onicolysis and pitting
all combined in 14 patients, only subungual hyperkeratosis in 10
patients, pitting in 7 patients, 7 of them showed only onycholysis
on both hands and 6 patients had oil spotting and pitting together.
In patients without psoriatic arthritis the prevalence of dissorders
in all affected groups was in male patients.
Conclusion: Nail psoriasis engenders both physical and psychological
handicap, leading to significant negative repercussions in
the quolity of life. The presence of nail disease in a patient with
psoriasis may indicate a severe form of the disease and must be
taken into account when selecting a treatment otion, with an aim to
reduce pain, functional impairment as well as emotional distress.

PSORIASIS HIDDEN IN GOTTRON’S PAPULES
Florentina Berianu, Juan J. Maya
Mayo Clinic Florida
Introduction: Patients with Dermatomyositis (DM) present with
rashes in a photosensitive distribution and occasionally a scaly
rash over elbows, knees and scalp can resemble psoriasis. The
biopsy of such lesions shows interface dermatitis which is highly
distinguishing for DM. In rare occasions, patients can suffer
from both DM and psoriasis (Ps). Objectives: To report a case of
Dermatomyositis and Psoriatic arthritis
Method: 45 years old female presented with a red, itchy rash with
diffuse swelling over the entire body associated with swallowing
difficulties and weakness affecting mainly the proximal muscles
of upper and lower extremities. She has pain and stiffness in her
hands and feet. DM was confirmed based on specific findings on
skin biopsy, EMG with myopathic features and a muscle biopsy
that confirmed the myopathy. Patient had insulin dependent diabetes
and IVIG was the initial choice of therapy to avoid steroid
use. Patient responded excellent in regards to generalized rash
and had reported improvement in regards to proximal muscle
weakness and swallowing difficulties but she had persistence of
the scaly rash over elbows, knees and developed what resembled
dactylitis along with worsened asymmetric inflammatory arthritis
of ankle, hand and feet joints. Based on her presentation, Ps and
psoriatic arthritis (PsA) were diagnosed. Methotrexate was added
and patient had improved in skin psoriasis along with inflammatory
arthritis. Results: Ps and PsA were associated with DM in this
patient. These are distinct diseases that have parallel courses and
require different therapeutic approaches.
Conclusion: Ps has been reported in association with Connective
Tissue Diseases. Gotron’s papules can resemble Ps in patients
with DM but rare case reports have described concomitant DM
and Ps. The association of DM, Ps and PsA was even more rarely
described.

Introduction: Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory skin
disease, which is gradually being recognized as a systemic inflammatory
disorder. Psoriasis and obesity are strongly linked, but
there is not enough data whether obese psoriatic patients present
differently from non-obese psoriatic patients.
Objective: To compare the phenotype, clinical features, severity,
baseline comorbidities and laboratory findings among psoriatic
patients with/without obesity.
Methods: All the psoriatic patients, from three centers, who were
receiving systemic therapy were included in the study. Patients
were divided into two groups: those with obesity and those without
obesity.
Results: We included 497 patients: 154 (31%) patients were obese
and 343 (69%) were non-obese. Obese patients had more comorbidities,
particularly hyperlipidemia, followed by hypertension and
diabetes. Fasting blood sugar and serum lipids were significantly
higher among obese subjects.
Conclusions: Given the differences between obese patients and
non-obese patients, the former group should be followed and
managed more closely and with specific attention.

PSORIASIS AND COMORBIDITY
Veranika Liubiankova, Sviatlana Makarava
Mogilev Regional Centre of Dermatology and Venerology
Introduction. In recent years special attention has been paid not
only to the systemic nature of the process in psoriasis, but also
to its association with comorbidities. Comorbidity is a regular
combination of various diseases or conditions in one patient, it
occurs in many inflammatory processes.
Objectives: The study of the incidence of concomitant diseases in
patients with psoriasis in relation to patients with allergic contact
dermatitis, analysis by age group.
Methods: A retrospective analysis of data of 804 patients, who
were treated in 2016–2017 in Mogilev Regional Dermatology and
Venerology Centre with different forms of psoriasis, was conducted.
492 males, 312 females. The mean age was 43.05 years. The
control group consisted of patients with allergic contact dermatitis,
comparable in age and sex, in an amount of 397 people.
Results: Specific gravity and incidence of comorbidity in patients
with psoriasis: cardiovascular damage 41% (331), gastrointestinal
tract - 30.4% (245), endocrine system - 22.7% (183), metabolic
syndrome - 28.2% (227), chronic otorhinolaryngological diseases
- 11.4% (92), diseases of urinary system - 6.2% (50), respiratory
system - 4.7% (38). Significant differences between the groups
were obtained for all the comorbidity except respiratory diseases.
Psoriatic polyarthritis were observed in 219 patients (27.3%), nail
psoriasis – in 117 patients (14.6%). The average body mass index
in the psoriasis group was 27.2, in the allergic contact dermatitis
group - 25.3. Significant differences between the groups were
obtained for all the laboratory test changes except the general
bilirubin, C-reactive protein and urinalysis. The percentage of diseases
changed with increasing age: diseases of the cardiovascular
system from 10% to 87%, gastrointestinal diseases from 20% to
61%, endocrine system diseases - from 14.5% to 38%, metabolic
syndrome - from 11% to 34%, otorhinolaryngological diseases -
from 15% to 8.5%, diseases of the urinary system - from 1.8% to
8.5%, respiratory system diseases – from 1.8% to 13%.
Conclusions: The analysis showed that in patients with psoriasis
the most frequent comorbidity are: cardiovascular and gastrointestinal
diseases, endocrine disorders, polyarthritis, nail psoriasis
and metabolic syndrome. A rather high risk of comorbidity is
established, in comparison with the population, which can directly
affects the severity of the course of the disease, the effectiveness
of the therapy and life expectancy.

RISK OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE IN PATIENTS WITH
CHRONIC PLAQUE PSORIASIS
Veronica Lopez Castillo, Inmaculada Lopez Castillo, Pedro Rodriguez,
Jose Maria Ricart Vaya
Introduction: Psoriasis is a common, chronic, inflammatory,
multisystem disease affecting approximately 2% of population. It
has been associated with certain diseases and there is a strong link
between metabolic syndrome and psoriasis. Chronic periodontitis
is an infectious disease resulting in inflammation within the supporting
tissues of the teeth, progressive attachment loss, and bone
resorption and clinically characterized by pocket formation and/
or gingival recession. Psoriasis and chronic periodontitis share
common risk factors and co-morbidities.
Objective: The aim of our study was to determine how frequently
chronic periodontitis is associated with patients with psoriasis
compared to systemic healthy subjects and if its presence is associated
to severity of psoriatic lesions.
Methods: Baseline demographic data including sex, age, smoking
habits, family history of psoriasis or periodontal disease was
recorded in 40 psoriasis subjects and 40 healthy subjects. Information
on comorbidities and pharmacological treatment, daily
tooth brushing, the presence of gingival bleeding, location of skin
lesions, weight and height were also evaluated. The periodontal
clinical parameters probing depth, periodontal attachment level,
plaque index and presence or absence of radiographic bone loss
were recorded. The severity of psoriasis was assessed by Psoriasis
Area and Severity Index. A complete blood test was asked for all
subjects included in the study.

Acta Derm Venereol 2018
Results: During the study enrolment period 40 patients with
psoriasis and 40 age- and gender-matched controls were included
in this study. Probing depth and periodontal attachment level
showed significant higher values in psoriasis group compared to
healthy subjects.
Conclusions: We found evidence of a psoriasis-associated increased
risk of periodontitis. Thus, dermatologists should be
aware of this comorbidity because these patients should be closely
followed-up by a dentist for the adequate and early treatment of
periodontitis. Periodontitis may be associated with psoriasis but
further studies are needed to elucidate their relationship.

SPLENOMEGALY AND PSORIASIS - A CASE REPORT
Suzana Ozanic Bulic
Department of Dermatovenerology, KBC Sestre milosrdnice, Zagreb,
Croatia
Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory disease associated
with numerous comorbidities that have been well documented in
the literature. Comorbidities often become clinically evident years
after the onset of psoriasis and are related to persistent low-grade
inflammation with secretion of proinflamamtory cytokines, as
seen in metabolic syndrome(1). Nevertheless, the evidence shows
new emerging comorbidities that share link with psoriasis. Hjuler
et al. observed increased splenic inflammation in patients with
moderate-to-severe psoriasis (2). They also showed that splenic
activity was correlating with aortic wall inflammation in psoriasis
patients, explaining the increased risk of heart disease (2).
A 56-year old patient with chronic plaque psoriasis (Fig 1) for
more than thirty years, presented with splenomegaly, diabetes
type two, arterial hypertension, chronic kidney disease stage III,
obesity, with BMI > 40, and depression. Psoriasis severely flared
up in 2012, and on workup up for cataract operation, enlarged
lymph nodes were observed and further confirmed on CT scans in
axillae, inguinum, mediastinum and upper abdomen. Patient was
hospitalized at haematology department and reactive lymphadenopathy
due to skin inflammation was diagnosed. Acitretin was
started and stopped after a week for worsening of pancytopenia,
and Methotrexate was stopped after two weeks for triple increase
in liver enzymes, although the dose was of only 5 mg weekly. In
August 2017, repeated blood tests were normal and abdominal
US showed no progression in hepato-splenomegaly, with spleen
measuring 23 cm. Psoriasis was severe, with PASI 36, BSA 31%
and DLQI 19. Ustekinumab 90 mg was started in October 2017
with PASI75 achieved after 12 weeks of treatment. Patient has
been closely monitored with no haematological side-effects on
last assessment.
Significant splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy with no underlying
haematological disease has not been described as a comorbidity
of psoriasis. The treatment with biologics was delayed in our
patient as underlying haematological malignancy was suspected.
The untreated severe psoriasis flared up in the mean time the whole
spectrum of comorbidities, led by depression. Ustekinumab has
significantly improved his psoriasis (Fig 2), with improvement in
depression that was best observed in patient’s motivation to lose
weight and be referred for gastric bypass.
Effective control of psoriasis and associated conditions requires not
only appropriate treatment, but also management of comorbidities,
including screening and treatment by various specialists, as disease
is known for its cumulative impairment over patient’s lifetime (3).

Introduction: Cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities such as
ischemic heart disease and diabetes are known to be associated
with psoriasis. However, it is less clear whether this is due to common
life-style related risk factors such as overweight and smoking.
Objectives: We wished to investigate the association between
psoriasis and cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidity in a cohort
of middle-aged women, and at the same time taking the effect of
body mass index (BMI) and smoking into account.
Methods: The study population consisted of expectant mothers
in a large nationwide birth cohort established between 1996 and
2002. During pregnancy, the women were asked whether they
have ever had any skin diseases including psoriasis, and whether
the disease was diagnosed by a physician. The relation to selfreported
cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidity 11 years
after giving birth was assessed by multiple logistic regression.
Furthermore, we performed an analysis where the cohort was
followed up for hospital-diagnosed comorbidity including cardiac
death until 31st December 2014. Here the risk was assessed by
Cox proportional hazards regression. All analyses were adjusted
for age, pre-pregnant BMI, and smoking status collected at time
of inclusion during pregnancy.
Results: We identified 2,435 (2.90%) women with a history of
psoriasis and 81,388 women without psoriasis. The women with
and without psoriasis were on average respectively 30.4 (SD
4.5) and 29.9 (SD 4.3) years old at time of inclusion in the study.
Women with psoriasis had slightly higher BMI and smoked markedly
more than women without psoriasis (38.1% vs. 26.4%). A
history of psoriasis was significantly associated with self-reported
hypercholesterolemia (adjusted odds ratio 1.31; 1.01–1.70) and
hospital-diagnosed hypertension (adjusted hazard ratio 1.33;
1.08–1.65). A positive association was also found with respectively
hospital-diagnosed ischaemic heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and
hypercholesterolemia, however, these findings were not statistically
significant. No associations were found for self-reported
hypertension, thrombosis, or type 2 diabetes.
Conclusions: Women with psoriasis are at increased risk of
developing cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidity in early
adult life. This may suggest an importance of awareness of these
comorbidities also in younger patients with early screening for
hypertension, hyperglycemia, and hypercholesterolemia.

A CASE OF CONCURRENT PSORIASIS AND VITILIGO
Selma Poparic
Dermatology Department University Clinical Center of Ssrajevo
Introduction: Psoriasis and vitiligo are common dermatoses that
affect 1~3% (psoriasis) and 0.5% (vitiligo) of the general population,
respectively. Yet the pathogenesis of the association between
these two dermatoses is still unknown.
Case report: We report a case of a 52-year-old patient who was
admitted to our department with a 6-month history of squamous
papules and plaques on his right elbow region and both right and
left lower leg. He was also noticed with hypopigmented patches
on his right and left wrist. Anamnestic questionnaire revealed that
his mother has had similar discolorations on her skin, but never

5th World Psoriasis & Psoriatic Arthritis Conference 2018
underwent any diagnostic procedure, nor treatment. Clinical and
hystopathological diagnosis of erythematosquamous areas on the
patients right elbow and right and left lower leg was a plaque psoriasis,
while hypopigmented patches on his wrists were diagnosed
as vitiligo. Blood work up and T3, fT4, TSH, ANA laboratory tests
were within normal ranges.
Conclusion: Psoriasis and vitiligo, although seemingly unrelated
skin disorders, have a lot in common. Causes, incidence, and even
distribution seem to strongly correlate between these two.

SUCCESSFUL LONG-TERM DOUBLE DISEASE
CONTROL BY ADALIMUMAB IN A PATIENT WITH
PSORIASIS VULGARIS AND HIDRADENITIS
SUPPURATIVA

Introduction: Psoriasis vulgaris /PV/ is a chronic inflammatory
skin disease1. Studies have shown the role of genes important for
the transcription of inflammatory citokines, such as TNF alpha
and IL-23, which play main role in the patoghenesis of psoriasis2.
Hidradenitis suppurativa /HS/ is chronic inflammatory skin disease3,
in which pathogenesis are IL-23 and TNF alpha, supporting
the theory of the immunologic disease4. Adalimumab is human
monoclonal antibody that has a great affinity for the membrane of
TNF alpha5. We report the case of a 44-year-old Caucasian woman
with a history of PV and HS, both diseases are in remission during
the therapy with adalimumab.
Case report: We report the case of a 44-year-old Caucasian woman
with a history of PV and HS that started adalimumab therapy 3
years ago. PV started 14 years ago and was verified by skin biopsy.
Initially, the clinical course of psoriasis was mild and later she took
course to moderate psoriasis with PASI 10. Psoriasis was treated
only with local therapy. HS started when she was 38-years-old in
her left groin, as swelling and pain on palpation and in movement.
Skin changes started to develop also on the right groin and perianal
region as painful nodules, with pus draining, and fistula tracts.
Skin biopsy confirmed HS.Chest X-ray and gastroenterology
examination were performed to exclude any additional illnesses
and she also did a psychologcal testing. She was treated with different
antibiotics also prednisone and isotretinoin at a dose 1mg/
kg/day. Topical therapy was consisting of antibiotics, antiseptics
and hydrocolloid dressings. She had 3 surgical interventions. In
2015, she started adalimumab according to the scheme. On the
day of the initial aplication of adalimumab, patient had 4 abscesses,
13 nodules and 16 fistula tracts. She had successful clinical
response to the drug and is without psoriatic symptoms or HS
active lesions. Both diseases are successfuly controled and quality
of life has improved.

CLINICAL AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL
CARACTERIZATION OF PSORIASIS AND PSORIATIC
ARTHRITIS ON A MULTIDISCIPLINARY ASSESMENT
MODEL
Karla Del Rocio Macias-Garcia, Dalila Alejandra Lopez Rodriguez
Dermatologico Country
Introduction: Presentation and clinical course in Psoriasis are
heterogeneos. A multidisciplinary assessment model was designed
by five specialties: dermatology, rheumatology, internal medicine,
nutrition and psychiatry, to evaluate at the same time and place,
patients with psoriasis.
Objetive: To ascertain frequency of comorbilities in psoriatic patients
and conduct a clinical and epidemiological characterization.
Methods: Prospective study, from August 2016 to february 2018,
patients attending to Multidisciplinary Clinic for psoriasis in
Dermatologico Country were included.
Results: 53 patients were included. Median age was 42 years old
and 62.3% were female. Family history of psoriasis was found
in 26.4% patients and 19.4% had spodyloarthropathy family
history. Most common comorbidities found obesity, metabolic
syndrome, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension and fatty
liver. Affective assessment was found for 49.1% met criteria for
anxiety. Psoriasis found 96.2% with psoriasis in skin and 56.6%
in nails. Most common presentation of psoriasis, was plaque
psoriasis in 66%. PASI score showed 50.9% with mild disease,
15.1% moderate, and 34% had severe. NAPSI score was from 0
to 61, with a median of 3 (0.13). DLQI indicated that only 13.2%
had no condition in life quality, meanwhile 86.8% patients had
impaired quality of life. Psoriatic arthritis, and identify 58.5%
patients that met CASPAR criteria, axial disease was present in
51.6%, peripheral joint disease in 71% and in 13.2% both were
present. 54.8%(17) patients had enthesitis and 16.1% had dactilitis.
DAS28 was performed, and showed 45.2% with severe activity.
Total number of subjects with peripheral disease 100%, did not
met criteria for MDA. HAQ score to assess PsA patients quality
of life, revealed a median of 1.38 (1.10, 2.25).
Conclusions: we found that more than half of the patients presented
a severe form of psoriasis with significant quality of life impairment.
The number of psoriatic arthritis was higher than expected
with both axial and peripheral manifestations. We have found a
high proportion of patients with comorbidities such as metabolic
syndrome, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia and
obesity. We also found a high frequency of psychiatric illness.
The limitations of our study are the small sample to highlight
if comorbidities had an impact on the severity of skin and joint
disease. This multidisciplinary model has identified psoriasis as
a disease with an unpredictable course, which requires several
evaluations by a multidisciplinary model, with a group of experts
beyond Dermatologist and Rheumatologist.

of psoriasis. There are few prospective studies on the relation of
alcohol with the extent of psoriasis.
Objectives: The purpose of this prospective study was to further
investigate how alcohol affects psoriasis in female patients.
Methods: Twenty-two female psoriasis patients with light to
moderate psoriasis, with only local treatment and with a regular
alcohol intake, were recruited. The study was run for three years,
starting in 2014. We used Christmas and New Year, as intervention
period, when the amount of alcohol is expected to exceed normal
consumption. The total study period was 8 weeks. During the study
period, the alcohol intake was measured by the patients filling a
calendar, specifying the alcohol intake per day, moreover, the degree
of severity of psoriasis, degree of pruritus, and of perceived
stress, using a visual analog scale. In addition, the patients once a
week determined Self-Administered Psoriasis Area and Severity
Index (SAPASI).
Results: The alcohol intake, which was generally low to moderate,
increased during Christmas and New Year, reaching its maximum
during week 52 (Christmas week). There was a marginal increase
in the extent of psoriasis, determined by SAPASI, during week 52.
There was no correlation with alcohol intake nor pruritus. The level
of perceived stress decreased shortly after week 52, and reached
its lowest value during week 1, after that increasing.
Conclusion: Even if there is an increased alcohol consumption
during Christmas and New Year, there is no evident worsening
of psoriasis.

PSORIASIS AND CANCER. RETROSPECTIVE STUDY
IN THE PSORIASIS SECTOR OF THE DERMATOLOGY
SERVICE AT RAMOS MEJIA HOSPITAL
Jennifer Kreimer, Alejandra Crespo, Elena Chaparro, Daniela
Gonzalez, Veira Rosana, Kogan Nora
Introduction: Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic, immune-mediated
inflammatory disease that compromises the skin, attachments,
semi-mucosal, mucous membranes and joints. There are different
clinical forms that can vary in the same patient at different times
of life. It is accompanied by comorbidities that affect the quality
and survival of patients. Within the comorbidities associated with
psoriasis, malignancies constitute a prominent and controversial
group. In the review of the current literature, there would be
evidence of a relationship between psoriasis and cancer, given
the existence of structural and molecular similarities between the
two pathologies. Objectives: To assess the prevalence of cancer
development in patients with psoriasis in our population.
Methods: A retrospective epidemiological analysis of the total
population of 1969 patients with psoriasis is carried out, attended
in the psoriasis sector of the dermatology service of Ramos Mejía
Hospital in the period between January 2008 and January 2018.
Results: We identified 56 patients who presented coexistence of
oncological pathology and psoriasis of different severity: 38 severe,
14 moderate and 4 mild. The population was divided equally
between both sexes. Of these 56 patients, 61 tumors were detected
(non-melanoma skin cancer, solid tumors and lymphomas). The
oncological manifestations are the following: table 1.

of patients showed an incidence for all types of malignancies of
3.098% in this population. The diagnosis of psoriasis preceded the
oncological diagnosis in 50 of the patients studied.
Conclusions: The incidence of cancer in the general population
in Argentina, according to the Ministry of Health is 172.3–242.9
per 100,000 inhabitants. In our study population, we found an
incidence of 3.098%, which would support the hypothesis of an
increased risk of developing cancer in patients with psoriasis. The
risk was identical in both sexes and directly proportional to the
degree of severity of the psoriasis.

Introduction: Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are a heterogenous group
of neoplastic disorders characterized by clonal limphoid cell
proliferation. They rank sixth among the cancers in terms of the
frequency of occurrence in adults. Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia
is lymphoplasmic hyperplasia with excessive production of
monoclonal M-protein. According to literature data, patients with
psoriasis have more frequent lymphomas than healthy population.
The real risk of lymphoproliferative disease in psoriatic arthritis
patients has not yet been defined.
Objectives: The aim of the study was to describe a case of a patient
with psoriatic arthritis and concurent monoclonal gammopathy,
who did not respond to treatment with TNFalpha inhibitor in
combination with methotrexate.
Methods: A 57 year old woman with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis
diagnosed in 2012 (presence of HLA B27 antigen, arthritis of the
sacroiliac joints, peripheral arthritis) with monoclonal gammopathy
of undeterminated significance, was treated with non-steroid
anti-inflammatory drugs, methotrexate (20 mg once a week), folic
acid 15 mg and inhibitor of TNFalpha.
At the beginning of biological therapy she presented with laboratory
results: ESR 126, total protein 8 g/dl, abnormal IgM 11.6 g/l
(normal range 0.4–2.3 g/l), IgG 2.25 g/l (normal range 7–16g/l),
IgA 0.32 g/l (normal range 0.7–4 g/l). Immunofixation test revealed
possitivity for IgM kappa monoclonal protein. There were no
abnormalities in the bone marrow aspiration biopsy, no lymphadenopathy
was observed. She complained of general weakness
and polineuropathy. Analysis of spino-cerebral fluid showed type
V of oligoclonal band.
Results: In 2017, after 2 years of TNFalpha inhibitor combined
with methotrexate therapy, the diagnosis of Waldenstrom
macroglobulinemia has been done. The patient presented with
high ESR 103 and monoclonal IgM 33 g/l. Repeated aspiration
bone marrow biopsy showed 3% of plasmocytes and 21% of
lymphocytes.
Conclusions: The patient started standard RCD chemotherapy
regimen (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, dexamethason) with good
clinical response to therapy.

Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden
Introduction: Psoriasis is a complex, systemic disease associated
with comorbidities extending beyond the skin, often affecting
psychological well-being which may manifest as clinical depression.
Psoriasis can be viewed narrowly by focusing on the skin,
or holistically to include associated comorbidities. To date, the
complex interplay between psoriasis, comorbidities, and depression
has not been adequately described, and an innovative approach
is necessary to understand interrelationship between them.
Objectives: Calculate incidence rates of depression in psoriasis
patients compared to the general population and subsequently explore
the risk factors associated with depression onset. Determine
the contributions of comorbidities compared to narrowly defined,
psoriasis-only symptoms.
Methods: 96,666 psoriasis patients were matched to 15 controls
and followed from psoriasis onset until incident depression diagnosis
or censoring using population-based routine care data.
Incidence of depression was calculated using Poisson regression
models. Risk of depression onset using a narrow definition
of psoriasis was compared to a holistic definition including all
comorbidities using a Cox proportional hazards model, with additional
adjustment for sociodemographic factors. Comorbidities
were represented by ICD chapters with more than 5% correlation
with psoriasis. Sensitivity analysis examined the role of psoriatic
arthropathy, alternative depression definitions, and searched for
unobserved confounding.
Results: Patients with psoriasis have a higher incidence of clinical
depression than those without the disease. Holistically, psoriasis
was associated with an increased risk of depression onset of 40%
(HR = 1.404, p < 0.001), compared to 12% increase (HR = 1.115,
p < 0.001) when narrowly defined. The proportional hazards assumption
appeared to hold in each survival analysis. A substantial
portion, but not all, of psoriasis patients’ risk of depression onset
was attributable to comorbidities, and sociodemographic factors
did not appear to affect the estimates of association between
depression and psoriasis. Major differences were found between
antidepressant- and diagnosis-based definitions of depression,
while inclusion of psoriatic arthropathy did not affect the results.
No unmeasured confounding was identified.
Conclusions: Due to the elevated risk of depression in psoriasis
patients, treating physicians should ensure patients’ psychological
well-being is addressed, especially in those presenting with
additional risk factors, to break the cyclical relationship between
depression and psoriasis and improve patients’ quality of life.
Contemporary, holistic management of psoriasis patients should
encourage routine screening for depression.

EFFICACY OF ADALIMUMAB PLUS METHOTREXATE
IN PATIENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE PLAQUE
PSORIASIS
Ghasem Rahmatpour Rokni, Mohamad Goldust
Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences
Background: Adalimumab, a high-affinity monoclonal antibody
that selectively targets tumor necrosis factor alpha, is efficacious
in treating moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Currently there
are some reports regarding drug resistance to adalimumab (1,2).
Objective: This study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of adalimumab
plus methotrexate in patients with moderate to severe
plaque psoriasis.
Methods: In this cross sectional study, 23 patients suffering from
moderate to severe psoriasis were recruited. Patients received
adalimumab 80 mg week 0, 1 and then 40 mg every 2 weeks and
methotrexate up to 25 mg/week. The primary outcome measure
was the difference in Psoriasis area and severity index (PASI-
75) response after 12 weeks. The secondary outcomes included
PASI 75 at week 6 (onset of action) and week 12, Investigator’s
Global Assessment (IGA), Patient Global Assessment, impact on
quality of life (Skindex-17 and SF-36), Treatment Satisfaction
Questionnaire of Medication, duration of remission, maintenance
treatment and safety.
Results: In the study group, 86.9% (20 out of 23 patients) reached
PASI-75 at week 12. The longitudinal analysis showed a PASI
reduction of 6.42% per week. The onset of action was achieved
in 65.2%. At week 12, IGA ‘clear or almost clear’ was observed
in 91.3% (p < 0·01). Skindex-17 symptom score was significant
with combination therapy (p < 0·01). Maintenance treatment achieved
PASI 75 for 82.6% (p < 0·01). Mild adverse events were
reported in 79.5%.
Conclusion: Combination therapy of adalimumab plus methotrexate
is a highly effective, well-tolerated, maintenance therapy in
patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

ATTAINMENT OF REMISSION AND MINIMAL DISEASE
ACTIVITY AFTER STARTING METHOTREXATE
SUBCUTANEOUS THERAPY
Elena Loginova, Tatiana Korotaeva, Elena Gubar, Svetlana Glukhova,

Nasonova Research Institute of Rheumatology, Moscow
Introduction: Methotrexate (MTX) is the first-choice therapy in
psoriatic arthritis (PsA). There is limited data concerning efficacy
of early administration and rapidly dose escalation of MTX subcutaneous
(s/c) in early (E) PsA patients (pts).
Objective: to study attainment of remission (REM) or minimal
disease activity (MDA) after starting MTX s/c therapy in EPsA
pts treated according to treat-to-target (T2T) strategy.
Methods: 77 (M-37/F-40) pts with active EPsA, according to the
CASPAR criteria were included. Mean age 37.4±10.8 years (yrs.),
PsA duration 11±10 months (mon.), psoriasis duration 86±96.1
mon., DAPSA 32.45±12.7. At baseline all pts started MTX s/c
therapy. The dose of MTX s/c was escalated by 5 mg every 2
weeks from 10 mg/wk to appropriate dose 20–25 mg/wk according
to the drug intolerance. If the patient did not achieve remission
or MDA on MTX mono-therapy, biological (b)DMARDs was
added. At baseline and every 3 mon. of study (till 24 mon.) all
pts underwent assessment of PsA activity by DAPSA and MDA
criteria (tender joint count ≤ 1, swollen joint count ≤ 1, PASI ≤ 1 or
BSA ≤ 3, patient pain global assessment VAS ≤ 15, patient´s global
disease activity VAS ≤ 20, HAQ ≤ 0.5, enthesitis count ≤ 1). The
proportion of pts who achieved REM by DAPSA ≤ 4 and MDA (5
of 7 cutpoints), the timing of REM/MDA, the mean dose of MTX
during the study were performed. M±SD, Me [Q75; Q50], (%),
W-test were calculated. All p < 0.05 were considered to indicate
statistical significance.
Results: 36 out of 77 pts (46.75%) did not achieve REM or MDA in
MTX therapy within 7±5 mon. and bDMARDs were added. 5 out
of 77 pts (6.5%) stopped MTX therapy due to intolerance within
6±2 mon. 36 out of 77 pts (46.75%) went on taking MTX-monotherapy.
In 22 out of 36 pts, who had mean DAPSA 27.7±10.0 at
baseline, data was available by the 24 mon. of study. At baseline
median dose of MTX s/c was 15 [10;20], Min 10–Max 20 mg/
wk. At the third mon. of study median dose of MTX s/c was
escalated to 20 [20;20], Min 0–Max 25 mg/wk. After attainment
of REM/MDA the dose of MTX was decreased. At the end of the
study median dose of MTX s/c was 7.5 [0;15], Min 0–Max 20

mg/wk (fig.1). After starting MTX disease activity by DAPSA
significantly decreased by the third mon. and maintained till the
end of the study (fig.2). DAPSA-REM and МDA was reached
within 9.7±7.7 and 13.7±7.6 mon. accordingly. By the 24 mon.
of therapy stable REM by DAPSA and MDA was seen in 10 out
of 22 pts (45.5%) and in 16 out of 22 pts (72.7%) accordingly.
Conclusions: In half of EPsA pts early administration of MTX
s/c and rapidly dose escalation is effective and well tolerated.
After achieving REM or MDA, a decrease of the dose of MTX is
possible in most cases.

Introduction: Secukinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody
selectively targeting IL-17A, is highly efficacious in the treatment
of moderate to severe psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing
spondylitis (AS), with sustained efficacy and favorable
safety profile. Long term treatment with targeted therapies such
as secukinumab may be necessary in women of childbearing
age. Pre-clinical animal studies with secukinumab, which can
cross the placenta, do not indicate harmful effects with respect to
pregnancy, embryonic/fetal development, parturition or postnatal
development, however only limited data has been reported on
human pregnancies.
Objectives: Using the Novartis global safety database, we analyzed
the outcome of pregnancies where there was maternal or paternal
exposure to secukinumab.
Methods: The Novartis global safety database (covering all
secukinumab indications and including clinical trial and postmarketing
data) was searched for cases reporting pregnancy and
neonatal topics. All pregnancies where there was either maternal
or paternal exposure to secukinumab were included in the systematic,
independently validated analysis. The cut-off date was
25th June, 2017.
Results: Of 292 pregnancies reported, 141 (48.3%) came from
clinical trials, 79 (27.1%) were spontaneous reports and 72
(24.7%) were from post-marketing surveillance, with 238 cases
of maternal and 54 cases of paternal exposure. 175 patients received
secukinumab for psoriasis, 38 for PsA, 15 for AS and 62 for
other/unknown indications. The majority of patients discontinued
secukinumab in the first trimester of pregnancy; 18 did not discontinue.
Of 153 cases where the outcome was known, there were 73
full term normal neonates and 37 elective terminations. Rates of
spontaneous abortions were 30/292, 10.3% overall (30/153 known
outcomes, 19.6%). These are in line with previously reported rates
(15–20%) for the general population with maternal age of 30.6
(study mean). No still births ( > 20 weeks) were reported. Three
congenital abnormalities were reported following maternal and
1 paternal exposure, with no repeated pattern of abnormality. At
data cut-off, 32 pregnancies were ongoing.
Conclusions: There was no evidence for increased rates of adverse
pregnancy outcomes across indications with secukinumab in this
review of the safety database. Given the limited exposure reported
to date, the safe continuous use of secukinumab throughout
pregnancy requires further research.

Introduction: Genital psoriasis (GP) is often associated with impaired
sexual health. Ixekizumab (IXE) is a high-affinity monoclonal
antibody that selectively targets interleukin-17A.
Objective: To evaluate the effect of IXE on the impact of GP on
sexual activity during 12 weeks of treatment compared to placebo
(PBO) in patients with moderate-to-severe GP.
Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients
(n = 149) with moderate-to-severe GP were randomized (1:1) to
receive PBO or 80 mg IXE every 2 weeks following an initial
dose of PBO or 160 mg IXE. The impact of GP on sexual activity
was measured by pre-specified patient-reported outcomes including
the Genital Psoriasis Sexual Impact Scale (GPSIS), which
is composed of the Sexual Activity Avoidance (Avoidance) and
Impact of Sexual Activity on Genital Psoriasis Symptoms (Impact)
subscales, the Sexual Frequency Questionnaire (SFQ) item 2, and
the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) item 9. Of patients
with a baseline SFQ item 2 score ≥2, the percentage of patients
whose frequency of sexual activity was never (0) or rarely (1)
limited by GP (SFQ item 2 0/1) was examined. Among patients
with respective GPSIS subscale scores ≥3 at baseline, response
was measured as the percentage of patients whose frequency of
avoiding sexual activity was never (1) or rarely (2) impacted by GP
(GPSIS-Avoidance 1/2) and whose GP symptom worsening after
sexual activity was very low/none at all (1) or low (2) (GPSISImpact
1/2). DLQI item 9 response was measured as the percentage
of patients with no (0) or a little (1) impairment of sexual activity.
Treatment comparisons were made using a logistic regression
model with missing values imputed by non-responder imputation.
Results: IXE treatment reduced the impact of GP on sexual activity
at Week 12 versus PBO as assessed by SFQ item 2 0/1 (IXE 78.4%,
PBO 21.4%; p < 0.001), GPSIS-Avoidance 1/2 (IXE 76.7%, PBO
25.7%; p < 0.001), and DLQI item 9 0/1 (IXE 92.0%, PBO 56.8%;
p < 0.001). IXE was superior to PBO as early as Week 1 for SFQ
item 2 0/1 (p < 0.05), Week 2 for DLQI item 9 0/1 (p < 0.001),
and Week 4 for GPSIS-Avoidance 1/2 (p < 0.01). GPSIS-Impact
1/2 response rates suggested a trend of reduced impact of sexual
activity on GP symptoms (IXE 85.7%, PBO 52.9%; p = 0.062).
Conclusions: During 12 weeks of treatment, IXE resulted in a rapid
and significant decrease in the impact of GP on sexual activity,
including how often GP limited sexual frequency among patients
with moderate-to-severe GP.

Introduction: Secukinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody
that selectively neutralizes IL-17A, a key cytokine involved in
the development of psoriasis. Heterogeneity in clinical response
to targeted therapies such as secukinumab may be addressed by
flexible dosing.
Objectives: To compare downtitration of PASI90 responders to
6-weekly and uptitration of PASI≥75 to < 90 responders to twoweekly
secukinumab dosing with standard 4-weekly dosing.
Methods: OPTIMISE was a randomized, multicenter, open-label,
rater blinded Phase 3b study. 1647 subjects received secukinumab
300 mg at baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 then 4-weekly to Week 24.
At Week 24, PASI90 responders were randomized to secukinumab
300 mg q4w (n = 644) or q6w (n = 662) to Week 52; PASI≥75
to < 90 responders were randomized to secukinumab 300 mg q4w
(n = 114) or 2-weekly (q2w) (n = 92) to Week 52. Groups were
stratified by body weight ( < 90kg, ≥90kg).
Results: PASI90 response was maintained at Week 52 by 85.7%
subjects with q4w dosing vs 74.9% with q6w dosing; OR 1.91
(95% CI 1.44, 2.55). The primary endpoint, non-inferiority of q6w
vs q4w dosing in PASI90 responders, was not met. In PASI≥75
to < 90 responders, 46.5% of subjects achieved PASI90 response
by Week 52 with q4w dosing. PASI90 response at Week 52 was
numerically higher for q2w compared to q4w dosing (56.5% vs.
46.5%), but this difference did not reach statistical significance
(p = 0.1013). This numerical benefit of q2w dosing was even
higher in subjects weighing ≥ 90 kg (n = 49; 57.1% vs. 39.6%;
p = 0.1053). No new or unexpected safety signals were observed.
Conclusions: Non-inferiority of q6w vs. q4w dosing cannot be
claimed in maintaining PASI90 response achieved at Week 24.
Around half of PASI≥75 to < 90 responders at 24 weeks, can
achieve PASI90 response with continued q4w dosing. Subjects
with higher body weight may benefit from the q2w dosing.

Introduction: TNF-alpha cytokine plays an important role in the
regulation of activation, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis
of the immune cells. It is an important therapeutical target in the
treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. From its other roles, it plays
key part in formation and maintenance of granuloma through the
increased fagocytic capacity of macrophages and eradication of
intracellular pathogens, therefore its inhibitors pose a risk for
granulomatous infections and reactivation of latent tuberculosis.
Objectives: The main focus was to assess the infectious complications
of biologic anti-TNF-alpha treatment of chronic plaque
psoriasis with focus on the tuberculosis and reactivation of its
latent form. Moreover, the authors tried to establish possible risk
factors on the reactivation of latent tuberculosis.
Methods: The authors analyzed the group of 190 patients from
Middle-European population treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors,
as compared to other biologics, for the occurence of infectious
complications. Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) test was
performed before the start of the treatment and then every year,
in accordance with The Tuberculosis Network European Trials
Group (TBNET) consensus. Statistical analysis was performed
on the results.
Results: 3% of patients had permanently positive IGRA test (before
and after beginning of the treatmet) and in 28% of patients treated
by TNF inhibitors, conversion of IGRA test appeared with negative
test before treatment and positive test after administration of
biologics. No active tuberculosis was detected. The average time
of IGRA conversion was 3 years after beginning of treatment. The
only statistically significant predictor was age, with an increase
of age by one year associated with the 5.8% increase of risk of
IGRA conversion. Regarding other infectious complications, the
most common infections in patients treated with biologics were
respiratory and HPV infections. No severe infection leading to the
permanent discontinuation of treatment was observed.
Conclusions: Treatment with TNF-alpha inhibitors was associated
with statistically significant risk of IGRA test conversion. The only
established predictor of risk was age of patient, with no influence of
previous or concomittant systemic tretament. However, the limitation
was size of group of patients. The most common infections
were common respiratory infections and viral HPV infections.

Introduction: Patients’ perspectives on psoriasis (PsO) and psoriatic
arthritis (PsA) treatment are important in establishing better
approaches to their care.
Objectives: To assess treatment use and satisfaction among patients
with PsO/PsA in Scandinavia.
Methods: NORPAPP was an on-line survey carried out in Nov/
Dec 2015 using YouGov panels in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway.
Adults with physician-diagnosed PsO or PsA (n = 1221), answered
questions about contact with the healthcare system, and treatment
experience and satisfaction. Self-perceived disease severity was
dichotomised to severe (responses of “quite severe”, “very severe”
or “extremely severe”) and non-severe (“not particularly severe”
or “not severe at all”).
Poster abstracts 13
Acta Derm Venereol 2018
Results: Among respondents with PsO alone 38.9% had seen a
dermatologist in the past year, and 10.7% had never seen a dermatologist;
60.9% of those with PsA±PsO had seen a rheumatologist
in the past year; 14.3% had never seen a rheumatologist. Systemic
treatments had been used by 14.6% of respondents with PsO alone
and 58.5% with PsA±PsO. Respondents with self-perceived severe
symptoms and patient organization members (POMs) were more
likely than those with non-severe symptoms or non-members, to
have discussed systemic treatments with their physician and to
have used the treatments; however, 35.2% of respondents with
self-perceived severe symptoms had never discussed systemic
treatment with their physician. Asked about long-term health risks
of systemic treatments, 18–44 year-olds and POMs were less likely
to answer “don’t know” than 45–74 year-olds (47.7%–49.1% vs
66.7%–72.9%) or non-members (26.1%–30.7% vs 66.8%–70.4%).
Biologics had been used by 40.7% of POMs vs 6.9% of nonmembers,
and 21.5% of 18–44 year-olds vs 8.1% of 45–74 yearolds.
Among respondents using oral/injectable methotrexate 30.5%
were dissatisfied, 60.2% citing side-effects as the reason; 22.9%
of biologics users were dissatisfied, 28.9% citing lack of effect
and 28.1% citing side-effects.
Conclusion: In Scandinavia POMs and young patients are more
likely to receive systemic treatment. A high proportion of patients
are dissatisfied with their treatment because of side effects.

Introduction: Patient (pt)-centered care is gaining traction in
long-term disease management. We report on a multinational,
retrospective, cross-sectional study in psoriasis pts treated with
apremilast (APR), an oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, in a realworld
clinical setting.
Objectives: The study aims to identify important pt needs and
therapeutic benefits of APR.
Methods: Consecutive pts with chronic plaque psoriasis treated
according to routine clinical practice who could be contacted
6±1 mo after APR initiation were enrolled. Medical chart review,
standardized pt-reported outcome tools (PBI, TSQM-9), and pt/
physician questionnaires were used. An interim analysis of the first
104 pts from 40 sites in Germany (42), UK (31), and Sweden (31)
was performed using predefined descriptive statistics.
Results: 102 pt questionnaires were analyzed (98%). At 6±1 mo,
74 pts (71%) continued APR; 30 (29%) had discontinued APR
(lack of efficacy [14%], safety/tolerability [11%], other [4%]).
Assessment of pts’ main needs from a therapy (quite/very important
on the PBI) revealed the importance pts attributed to skin
involvement (93% of responders), confidence in healing (92%),
being itch free (85%), fewer side effects (84%), being able to lead
a normal everyday life (83%), and needing less time for daily
treatment (80%). Based on a clinically meaningful PBI score
≥1, 78% of pts achieved a benefit with APR after 6 mo. Mean
(SD) PBI score was 2.2 (1.3) and increased to 2.5 (1.2) for pts
on continued APR at 6 mo vs 1.6 (1.3) for pts who discontinued
APR. Pts achieved benefit related to skin involvement (60%),
confidence in healing (70%), itch (69%), side effects (60%), being
able to lead a normal everyday life (72%), and needing less
time for daily treatment (65%). Consistent with phase 3 studies,
most frequently reported AEs were diarrhea (19.2%), nausea
(16.4%), and headache (11.5%); 25% of pts reported weight loss
(no change, 71%; gain, 4%).
Conclusions: This interim analysis indicates main pt needs from a
therapy extend beyond skin improvement. Findings indicate APR
may address diverse pt needs.

Introduction: LAPIS-PSO is an ongoing, 52-week, prospective,
multicenter, observational cohort study in real-world dermatology
clinical settings in Germany.
Objectives: To present a 4-month interim analysis of patient (pt)-
reported outcomes and efficacy assessments of apremilast (APR)
among pts (n = 294; full analysis set [FAS], n = 196) who were
continuing APR at 4 mo.
Methods: Physician- and pt-reported outcomes for QOL, treatment
effectiveness, and treatment satisfaction were evaluated in pts with
psoriasis vulgaris during long-term APR treatment. The primary
endpoint at Visit 2 (~4 mo after baseline [BL]) is the proportion
of pts who achieve DLQI score ≤ 5 or improvement from BL in
DLQI score ≥5 points.
Results: At BL, mean (SD) age was 51.7 (13.20) years in the FAS;
90 pts (45.9%) were female. At APR initiation, 171 pts (87.3%)
had Physician’s Global Assessment of disease severity (PGA)
≥3 and 174 (89.2%) had Patient’s Global Assessment of disease
severity (PaGA) ≥3; mean psoriasis-involved BSA was 22.2%,
mean pruritus VAS score was 56.6 mm, and mean DLQI score
was 14.1. In all, 62.7% of pts had scalp PGA (ScPGA) ≥3; 42.5%
had palmoplantar PGA (PPPGA) ≥3. Among pts continuing APR
at 4 mo, 120/181 (66.3%) achieved DLQI score ≤ 5 or reduction
by ≥5 points. Mean (SD) improvement in BSA was −9.5% (14.91)
and mean (SD) percentage improvement in pruritus VAS score
was −47.3% (32.29). A total of 32.1% of pts achieved PGA 0
(clear) or 1 (minimal); 32.6% achieved PaGA 0 or 1. NAPSI-50
was achieved by 62.4% (53/85) of pts. In all, 58.4% (87/149) of
pts achieved ScPGA 0 or 1 and 69.0% (29/42) had PPPGA 0 or
1. AEs were consistent with the known safety profile of APR.
Eighty pts (27.8%) reported ≥1 AE; 1 AE occurred in ≥5% of pts
(diarrhea, n = 21 [7.3%]).
Conclusion: In routine clinical care in Germany, APR treatment
outcomes for pts with psoriasis vulgaris, including difficult-to-treat
locations such as the nails, scalp, palms, and soles, confirm the
broad efficacy of APR observed in clinical trials.

Introduction: PsA patients may have impaired functioning in home
or work activities. The phase 3b ACTIVE study assessed efficacy
of apremilast (APR) monotherapy in biologic-naive subjects
with active PsA who may have had exposure to 1 conventional
DMARD.
Objectives: Assess work productivity through Wk104.
Methods: Subjects were randomized (1:1) to APR 30 mg BID or
placebo (PBO). Subjects whose SJC/TJC did not improve ≥10%
at Wk16 were eligible for early escape. At Wk24, remaining
PBO subjects switched to APR. Work productivity and activity
impairment were assessed at baseline (BL) and Wk16 using the
WPAI:PsA; WPAI:PsA Absenteeism, Presenteeism, Work Productivity
Loss, and Activity Impairment subscale scores range
from 0% to 100%; higher scores indicate greater impairment.
Work-related subscales were assessed in employed subjects; activity
impairment was assessed in all subjects. Correlations were
examined at Wk16 between WPAI:PsA subscale and SF-36v2
domain scores (Physical Functioning [PF], Bodily Pain [Pain],
and Vitality [VIT]) associations with ACR20 response. Work
productivity improvement was assessed to Wk104.
Results: BL characteristics were similar between groups. At Wk16,
APR improved work productivity and ability to carry out daily
activities vs PBO, with greater mean improvements in overall
Work Productivity Loss (p = 0.001) and Activity Impairment
(p < 0.001). Estimated mean change in Absenteeism score was
similar with APR vs PBO (p = 0.679). The Presenteeism score
showed significant improvement with APR vs worsening with PBO
(−10.8% vs 4.1%; P = 0.002). At Wk16, statistically significant
correlations were observed between WPAI:PsA subscale (except
Absenteeism) and SF-36v2 domain scores, as were associations
with ACR20 response. In subjects randomized to APR at BL,
Wk16 improvements were generally maintained to Wk104 in
those continuing APR.
Conclusions: In biologic-naive subjects with PsA, APR contributed
to overall improvement in work productivity at Wk16,
which correlated with SF-36v2 PF, Pain, and VIT scores and was
associated with ACR20 response; improvements in WPAI:PsA
subscale scores were generally maintained to Wk104.

Introduction: UNVEIL is the first study of apremilast in patients
(pts) with moderate psoriasis (BSA 5%-10%) naive to biologic
and systemic therapy.
Objectives: Improvements on physician and pt assessments over
52wks are described.
Methods: Pts with chronic moderate plaque psoriasis (BSA 5%-
10%; sPGA = 3 [0–5 scale]) were randomized (2:1) to apremilast
30 mg BID (APR) or placebo (PBO) for 16wks. Pts continued APR
(APR/APR) or switched from PBO to APR (PBO/APR) through
Wk52 (open-label treatment). Physician assessments were product
of sPGA and BSA (PGAxBSA), proportion of pts who achieved
sPGA score 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and PGAxBSA-75 (≥75%
improvement from baseline [BL]). Pt assessments were Dermatology
Life Quality Index (DLQI), pruritus VAS (0–100 mm),
Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM),
and Pt’s Global Assessment (PtGA [0–4 scale]).
Results: In randomized pts (PBO n = 73; APR n = 148), mean BL
BSA was 7.2%, PGAxBSA was 21.8, DLQI was 11.0, and pruritus
VAS was 56.6mm. At Wk16, mean improvement in PGAxBSA
was greater with APR vs PBO (−48.1% vs −10.2%; P < 0.0001);
more pts achieved sPGA 0 or 1 and PGAxBSA-75 with APR vs
PBO (30.4% vs 9.6% and 35.1% vs 12.3%). At Wk16 achievement
of DLQI response (≥5-point decrease in pts with BL DLQI > 5)
was greater with APR vs PBO (63.8% vs 34.5%), as were pruritus
VAS response (improvement ≥20%: 62.8% vs 45.2%) and TSQM
global satisfaction (63.2 vs 48.7) and effectiveness (57.3 vs 38.8).
More pts had PtGA ≤ 1 with APR vs PBO (33.8% vs 20.5%). At
Wk52, PGAxBSA changes were −42.2% (PBO/APR) and −55.5%
(APR/APR); 45.3% (PBO/APR) and 42.1% (APR/APR) of pts
achieved PGAxBSA-75, 35.9% (PBO/APR) and 33.1% (APR/
APR) achieved sPGA response, 55.6% (PBO/APR) and 59.4%
(APR/APR) achieved DLQI response, and 68.8% (PBO/APR) and
66.9% (APR/APR) achieved pruritus VAS response. TSQM global
satisfaction (PBO/APR 59.2; APR/APR 59.9) and effectiveness
(PBO/APR 57.7; APR/APR 54.1) were similar between groups at
Wk52; 42.2% (PBO/APR) vs 37.2% (APR/APR) had PtGA ≤ 1.
Conclusion: Physician and pt assessments improved with APR
up to 52wks in biologic- and systemic-naive pts with moderate
psoriasis.

Introduction: Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are associated
with high prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome. In phase
3 trials, apremilast, an oral PDE4 inhibitor, was efficacious in
patients (pts) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (ESTEEM
1 and 2 [EST]) and active PsA (PALACE 1–3 [PAL]).
Objectives: To explore potential effects of apremilast on metabolic
parameters, we assessed weight change and A1c in pts receiving
placebo (PBO) or apremilast 30 mg twice daily (APR) in a pooled
analysis of EST and PAL.
Poster abstracts 15
Acta Derm Venereol 2018
Methods: Mean A1c change and mean percent weight change at
Wk16 were compared among pts with baseline (BL) A1c < 5.7%,
5.7% to 6.4% (prediabetes), and ≥6.5% (diabetes) and between pts
reporting/not reporting concomitant insulin use. Spearman rank correlations
between percent change from BL in weight and change in
A1c at Wk16 were calculated; p < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results: In the pooled EST-PAL population, 2,242 pts (PBO
n = 913; APR n = 1,329) received study medication at BL. In all,
230 pts had BL A1c ≥6.5%. At Wk16, A1c change in pts with
BL A1c < 5.7% was 0.02 with PBO and 0.04 with APR. In pts
with BL A1c 5.7% to 6.4%, small changes were observed (PBO
−0.07; APR −0.12). Greatest A1c changes were in pts with BL
A1c ≥6.5% (PBO −0.08; APR −0.31). At Wk16, mean weight
change was 0.11% (PBO) and −1.32% (APR). In pts reporting
and not reporting concomitant insulin use, mean weight change
was 0.05% and 0.12% with PBO, respectively, and −1.83% and
−1.31% with APR. Weight change in pts with BL A1c < 5.7%,
5.7% to 6.4%, and ≥6.5% was 0.02%, 0.26%, and 0.11% with
PBO, respectively, and −1.24%, −1.35%, and −1.68% with APR.
Correlations between changes in weight and A1c were generally
low, with greater correlation in APR pts with higher BL A1c. Correlation
was statistically significant in APR pts with BL A1c ≥6.5%.
Conclusion: With APR, decreases in weight and A1c were greater
in pts with higher BL A1c. Pts receiving APR and insulin had
weight loss despite the association between insulin use and weight
gain. Future studies may be warranted to determine whether reductions
in A1c with APR are independent of weight loss.

BC, 7AbbVie Corporation, Montreal QC, Canada
Background: Observational studies comparing the effectiveness
of adalimumab (ADA) to non-biologic DMARDs (nbDMARD) in
PsA patients failing prior treatment are scarce. COMPLETE-PSA
is a Canadian observational study which assessed effectiveness
of ADA and non-biological therapies (NSAIDs and DMARDs)
among PsA patients failing previous therapy.
Objectives: To describe the baseline (BL) demographic and disease
parameters and to compare 12-month real-life effectiveness of
patients initiating nbDMARD or ADA.
Methods: Eligible patients eligible are anti-TNFα naïve adults,
with active PsA requiring a treatment regimen change, per the
treating physician’s judgment. This analysis included patients
enrolled during Jul/2011–Jun/2016. Outcome measures analyzed
were: DAS28, SF-12, DLQI, presence of extra-articular manifestations
(EAMs; enthesitis & dactylitis), psoriasis BSA, achievement
of modified MDA (achievement of [i] 4/6 (MDA 1) and [ii] 5/6
following criteria (MDA 2): TJC ≤ 1, SJC ≤ 1, BSA ≤ 3%, pain
VAS ≤ 15mm, PtGA ≤ 20 and HAQ ≤ 0.5), modified remission
(SJC = 0, TJC = 0, absence of enthesitis and dactylitis, BSA ≤ 3%
and HAQ ≤ 0.5), DAPSA LDA ( ≤ 14), and DAPSA remission
(REM; ≤ 4). Analyses were conducted by initial group assignment
(intent-to-treat approach).
Results: 406 patients were included (nbDMARD n = 146, ADA
n = 260). BL demographics were comparable between treatment
groups. However, patients initiating ADA were more likely to be
unemployed (47.3% ADA vs 34.9% nbDMARD, p = 0.015), had
higher DAS28 (4.8 vs 4.4, p = 0.002) and total DLQI score (6.1
vs 4.3, p = 0.007), and were more likely to have BSA≥3% (44.6%
vs 35.0%, p = 0.063) and high DAPSA disease activity (50.8%
vs 32.3%, p = 0.015). A higher proportion of nbDMARD patients
had dactylitis (36.1% vs 25.3%, p = 0.023). No differences were
observed between groups in enthesitis, overall EAMs, or QoL
at BL. Following 12 months, mean adjusted DAS28 (2.6 vs 3.4,
p < 0.001) and DLQI (2.2 vs 2.9, p = 0.530) scores, but not SF-12,
were lower in the ADA group. Furthermore, even though statistical
significance was not always met, ADA patients had lower DAPSA
score (p = 0.025) (LDA/REM: 64.9% vs 58.6%; REM: 37.7% vs
17.1%), were more likely to be in modified remission (14.7% vs
9.7%, p = 0.311), and to have mMDA (mMDA 1: 15.6% vs 12.6%,
p = 0.529; mMDA 2: 17% vs 11.5%, p = 0.253) and BSA < 3%
(89.3% vs 83.9%, p = 0.207). Also, EAM prevalence decreased in
both groups but was significantly lower in the ADA group (17.4%
vs 35.8%, p < 0.001). Over time, 9.6% of ADA patients initiated
another biologic and 32.2% of patients in the nbDMARD group
initiated biologic treatment (p < 0.001).
Conclusions: PsA patients initiating ADA in Canadian routine
clinical care have significantly greater BL disease severity compared
with those initiating nbDMARDs. However, 12-month
ADA treatment resulted in improved disease control and EAMs.
DAPSA-REM evaluation seems more sensitive than mMDA in
differentiating both populations.

(MTX) use from 4 Phase 3 studies: FUTURE 2,3,4,5.
Methods: A total of 2148 pts with active PsA were randomised in
FUTURE 2, 3, 4 and 5 studies (397, 414, 341 and 996, respectively).
Study designs were described elsewhere.1–4 Assessments
included ACR20/50 by prior TNFi use (naïve/inadequate response
or intolerance [-IR]) and with/without MTX use.
Results: Out of 2049 pts in analysis, 461, 572, 335, and 681 pts
received SEC 300mg, 150mg, 150mg without load (NL) and placebo
(PBO), respectively. ACR 20/50 responses were improved
with SEC vs PBO at Wk 16 in both TNFi-naive/-IR pts and pts
with/without concomitant MTX use (Table); improvements were
also observed with SEC vs PBO for all other secondary endpoints.
Conclusions: SEC provided improvement in the signs and
symptoms of active PsA regardless of previous TNFi therapy or
concomitant MTX use. Higher response rates were observed in
TNFi-naïve pts compared to TNFi-IR pts. SEC 300mg was associated
with higher responses compared to 150mg in pts with
TNFi-IR and no concomitant MTX use.

Background: Previous studies have shown the efficacy of anti-
TNFα agents in improving nail, skin and joint manifestations of
psoriatic arthritis (PsA). However, real-world data on the comparative
effectiveness of switching to or adding these agents vs.
continuing non-biologic treatments in patients having failed prior
non-biologic treatment are necessary to support the integration of
treatment algorithms into routine care.
Objectives: The aim of this analysis was to compare the effect
of adalimumab (ADA) vs. non-biologic treatments (nbDMARD:
NSAIDs and DMARDs) on skin outcomes and patient reported
outcomes following initial treatment failure. In addition, the impact
of the extent of baseline skin disease on treatment outcomes
was examined.
Methods: Patients eligible for COMPLETE PsA are anti-TNFα
naïve adults, with active PsA who require change in their treatment
regimen, per the judgment of the treating physician. In the current
analysis patients enrolled between July/2011 – Jun/2016 who had
available information on baseline psoriasis body surface area (BSA)
were included. Outcome measures analyzed were: BSA, Dermatology
Life Quality Index (DLQI), Short Form Health Survey
(SF-12), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Analyses were
conducted by initial group assignment (intent-to-treat approach).
Results: A total of 392 patients were included (ADA n = 249,
nbDMARD n = 143). Baseline demographics and disease duration
were comparable between treatment groups. However, patients
initiating ADA were more likely to have BSA≥3% (44.6% vs.
35%, p = 0.063) and had higher DLQI (6.2 vs. 4.3, p = 0.006)
scores. No differences were observed in SF-12 physical (PCS)
and mental (MCS) component scores at baseline.
During treatment, BSA levels significantly improved in both
groups but more patients achieved a BSA < 3% when treated
with ADA vs. nbDMARD both at 6 months (89.7% vs. 80.2%,
p = 0.027) and 12 months (89.0% vs. 83.7%, p = 0.222). Furthermore,
upon adjusting for baseline scores, patients in the ADA
group experienced greater improvements in DLQI (ΔLSM = -1.62,
p = 0.004), particularly in the daily activities, leisure, and work/
school domains, and SF-12 PCS (ΔLSM = 0.36, p < 0.001). These
differences between groups in BSA levels and DLQI improvement
were more profound among patients with BSA≥3% at baseline.
During follow-up, 9.2% of ADA patients initiated another biologic
and 32.2% of patients in the nbDMARD group initiated biologic
treatment (p < 0.001).
Conclusions: PsA patients starting ADA following initial failure
of non-biologic treatment in Canadian routine clinical care
experience greater benefits in skin outcomes and quality of life
compared to switching to different non-biologic treatment. These
benefits are particularly evident among patients with more severe
skin disease at baseline.

Introduction: Ixekizumab (IXE), a high-affinity monoclonal
antibody that selectively targets interleukin-17A, is approved for
treatment of patients (pts) with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and
provides persistent efficacy through 52 weeks (wks) of treatment.
Objective:To evaluate the efficacy of IXE treatment over 52 wks on
nail and skin psoriasis in biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic
drug (bDMARD)-naïve and -experienced pts with active PsA.
Methods: Adult pts with active PsA were bDMARD-naïve (SPIRIT-
P1) or -experienced (SPIRIT-P2, TNF inhibitor inadequate
responders [TNFi-IR] or intolerant). Pts were randomized to IXE
80 mg every 2 (Q2W) or 4 wks (Q4W), placebo, or (in SPIRITP1)
40 mg adalimumab Q2W. Efficacy of IXE on nail and skin
psoriasis in patients randomized to IXE was measured by the Nail
Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI), Psoriasis Area and Severity
Index (PASI), and static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA).
Missing data were imputed using nonresponder imputation for
categorical variables and modified baseline observation carried
forward for continuous variables.
Results: IXE provided high clinical response in skin and nail
psoriasis that persisted through 52 wks of treatment, regardless
of IXE dosing or prior bDMARD use (Table).

Introduction: Treatment goals in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are moving
toward attainment of absolute therapeutic thresholds rather
than relative improvement.
Objective:To explore the effect of ixekizumab (IXE), an anti-IL-
17A monoclonal antibody, as assessed by composite endpoints,
up to 52 weeks (wks) for the SPIRIT-P1 and SPIRIT-P2 trials.
Poster abstracts 17
Acta Derm Venereol 2018
Methods: Data were analyzed from 2 double-blind, phase 3 trials
investigating the efficacy and safety of IXE in active PsA patients
(pts). For SPIRIT-1 [1] biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic
drug-naïve pts were randomized to placebo (PBO, n = 106) or
80 mg IXE every 4 wks (Q4W, n = 107) or every 2 wks (Q2W,
n = 103) post 160 mg starting dose. For SPIRIT-2 [2] (inadequate
responders to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors [TNFi]) pts were
randomized to PBO (n = 118) or 80 mg IXE Q4W (n = 122) or
Q2W (n = 123) post 160 mg starting dose. Minimal disease activity
(MDA), MDA very low disease activity (VLDA), Disease
Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) LDA, DAPSA remission,
Psoriatic Arthritis Disease Activity Score (PASDAS) LDA, and
PASDAS VLDA composite endpoints were evaluated. Imputation
for categorical responses was non-responder imputation.
Treatment comparisons (with placebo up to Wk 24) based on the
intent-to-treat population were made using a logistic regression
model. Data up to Wk52 are summarized.
Results: At Wk 24, percentage of pts achieving MDA (SPIRIT-P1
Q4W: 29.9; Q2W: 40.8; PBO: 15.1; SPIRIT-P2 Q4W: 27.9; Q2W:

20.4; PBO: 1.9; SPIRIT-P2 Q4W: 13.1; Q2W: 7.3; PBO: 0.0) was
greater with Q4W and Q2W versus placebo.
Similarly, at Wk 52 the response rates were either sustained or
improved: MDA (SPIRIT-P1 Q4W: 39.3; Q2W: 36.9; SPIRIT-P2
Q4W: 34.4; Q2W: 23.6), MDA VLDA (SPIRIT-P1 Q4W: 14.0;
Q2W: 15.5; SPIRIT-P2 Q4W: 12.3; Q2W: 6.5), DAPSA LDA
(SPIRIT-P1 Q4W: 30.8; Q2W: 29.1; SPIRIT-P2 Q4W: 34.4; Q2W:
26.0), DAPSA remission (SPIRIT-P1 Q4W: 22.4; Q2W: 29.1;
SPIRIT-P2 Q4W: 18.9; Q2W: 11.4), PASDAS LDA (SPIRIT-P1
Q4W: 43.0; Q2W: 50.5; SPIRIT-P2 Q4W: 45.1; Q2W: 30.9), and
PASDAS VLDA (SPIRIT-P1 Q4W: 17.8; Q2W: 26.2; SPIRIT-P2
Q4W: 17.2; Q2W: 11.4).
Conclusions: Regardless of previous TNFi exposure, a higher
proportion of IXE-treated pts achieved MDA and MDA VLDA,
DAPSA LDA and DAPSA remission, and PASDAS LDA and
PASDAS VLDA at Wk 24 versus placebo. At Wk 52, the extent
of IXE clinical response sustained or further improved.

THE MACROPHAGE MODULATOR MP1032 SHOWS
SAFETY AND EFFICACY IN A HUMAN PHASE IIA
STUDY FOR THE TREATMENT OF MODERATE-TOSEVERE
PLAQUE PSORIASIS

Introduction: MP1032 belongs to a new class of anti-inflammatory
drugs that modulate the redox state of activated macrophages.
MP1032 attenuates pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in vivo
and in vitro and has pronounced disease-modifying effects in
various preclinical models.
Objectives: This randomized, double-blind, parallel, and placebocontrolled
trial aimed to evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety, and
efficacy of orally administered MP1032 in patients with moderateto-
severe plaque psoriasis.
Methods: Forty-six patients with chronic plaque psoriasis (PASI >
10; disease duration ≥ 6 months) were equally randomized to
receive either 100 mg MP1032 or placebo by twice daily oral
administration. The study design consisted of a 42 day treatment
period with a follow-up of 28 days. Pharmacokinetic sampling
occurred on day 1 at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min post-dose. Adverse
events were coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities. Efficacy parameters were assessed at screening
and on day 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, and 71.
Results: Enrolled patients had an average age of 40 years (21–65
years) and a median baseline PASI of 13.6 (ranging from 10.1 to
40.8). Pharmacokinetic evaluation demonstrated that MP1032
was rapidly absorbed, reaching maximum plasma concentrations
within 15 min after administration. Then, MP1032 plasma levels
were quickly declining, indicating a fast elimination. Safety
analysis did not reveal any clinically important safety issues. No
serious adverse events or deaths were reported and the incidence
of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) between placebo
and the MP1032 treatment group was comparable. The majority
of TEAEs were mild to moderate in nature (mostly common cold,
headache, and itching). Analysis of clinical laboratory data and
vital signs did also not reveal any adverse effects of MP1032. After
only six weeks of treatment, MP1032 led to a PASI reduction of
about 25% in patients who entered the study with a PASI of 10–15.
In contrast, placebo administration reduced the respective PASI
only about 12%. During the four-week follow-up period, median
PASI scores in the MP1032 group trended back upward while the
placebo group remained unchanged, suggesting a positive therapeutic
effect of MP1032. Since, patients with a lower basal PASI
had greater improvements during therapy than those with higher
scores, MP1032 seems to be a treatment option for patients with
mainly moderate psoriasis.
Conclusion: After six weeks of treatment, there was a clinically
relevant response in patients who entered the study with PASI
scores of 10–15. Overall, MP1032 demonstrated an excellent
safety profile and was well tolerated. Hence, redox modulation
targeted at the innate immune response represents a promising
new therapeutic mechanism for psoriasis and other chronic inflammatory
diseases.

Introduction/Objectives: Secukinumab (SEC), a fully human mAb
to IL-17A, has shown efficacy in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Here
we present the primary results of FUTURE 5, assessing efficacy,
including inhibition of radiographic progression of subcutaneous
(sc) SEC 300 and 150mg in patients (pts) with PsA (1).
Methods: Pts (n = 996) with active PsA, were randomized (2:2:2:3)
to sc SEC 300mg with loading dosage (LD; n = 222), 150mg with
LD (n = 220), 150mg without LD (n = 222), or placebo (PBO;
n = 332). All groups received SEC or PBO at baseline (BL), Weeks
(Wks) 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then every 4 wks. Primary endpoint
was ACR20 at Wk16. Key secondary endpoint was radiographic
structural progression, as measured by modified total van der
Heijde Sharp score (mTSS).
Results: SEC significantly improved ACR20 at Wk16 vs PBO

5th World Psoriasis & Psoriatic Arthritis Conference 2018
(Table). Radiographic progression (mTSS) was significantly
inhibited at Wk24 in all SEC arms vs PBO (Table). A greater proportion
of pts had no radiographic progression (change from BL
in mTSS ≤ 0.5) with SEC vs PBO: 88% (300mg), 79% (150mg),
83% (150mg without LD), and 73% (PBO). Results for other
secondary endpoints are shown in Table. No unexpected safety
signals were reported.
Conclusions: Subcutaneous SEC 300 mg with LD and 150 mg
with and without LD provided rapid and clinically significant
improvements in the signs and symptoms of PsA and inhibited
radiographic progression. Safety profile was consistent with that
previously reported.

Introduction: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including Crohn’s
disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are common comorbidities
associated with psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and
ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Compared with the general population,
epidemiological studies have shown that patients (pts) with
psoriasis or PsA are at a 2–4-fold increased risk of developing CD
and a 2–3-fold increased risk of developing UC.1–5 Additionally,
in pts with AS, there is a 3–5-fold increased risk of IBD compared
with the general population.6 Secukinumab is a fully human monoclonal
antibody that neutralizes interleukin-17A and is approved
for the treatment of psoriasis, PsA, and AS.
Objectives: To evaluate the incidence of IBD, CD, and UC in pts
with psoriasis, PsA, or AS who received IL-17A-inhibition with
secukinumab from 21 phase 3/4 clinical trials of secukinumab for
psoriasis, PsA, or AS.
Methods: This analysis evaluated pooled data from fourteen phase
3 and one phase 4 psoriasis trials, three phase 3 PsA trials, and
three phase 3 AS trials. Pts with a history of IBD, but not active
ongoing IBD, were eligible for enrollment in these trials. Data
from all pts that received at least one dose of secukinumab were
included in this analysis. IBD reporting includes cases of CD, UC,
and IBD not otherwise specified (NOS).
Results: A total of 7355 pts receiving secukinumab were assessed
for the presence of IBD: 5181 with psoriasis, 1380 with PsA,
and 794 with AS. Over the entire treatment period, the mean total
exposure to secukinumab was 10,416.9 patient-years (pt-yrs) in
pts with psoriasis, 3866.9 pt-yrs in pts with PsA, and 1943.1 pt-yrs
in pts with AS. The exposure-adjusted incidence rate (EAIR) per
100 pt-yrs (95% confidence interval) of CD, UC, and IBD NOS in
secukinumab-treated pts were 0.05 [0.02, 0.11], 0.13 [0.07, 0.23],
and 0.01 [0.00, 0.05], respectively in the psoriasis studies; 0.08
[0.02, 0.23], 0.08 [0.02, 0.23], and 0.05 [0.01, 0.19], respectively
in the PsA studies; and 0.4 [0.2, 0.8], 0.2 [0.1, 0.5], and 0.1 [0.0,
0.3], respectively in the AS studies. Additionally, the incidence
of IBD, CD, and UC did not increase over time.
Conclusion: Pooled data from 21 studies indicated that the observed
exposure- adjusted incidence rates of IBD, CD, and UC with
secukinumab were low and did not increase over time in pts with
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, PsA, or AS.

Introduction: Since 1994 a combination of fumaric acid esters
(FAEs) (dimethylfumarate [DMF] plus three salts of monoethylfumarate
[MEF]) has been approved in Germany for moderateto-
severe psoriasis, however is not widely licensed elsewhere.
While a new formulation of DMF has been recently approved by
the European Commission (June 2017) as monotherapy for adults
with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, only UK (NICE) guidelines
mention DMF to date.[1]
Method: Current treatment guidelines for plaque psoriasis in
several European countries are reviewed to determine if these
guidelines include therapy with FAEs and how these may guide
the use of DMF monotherapy in the future.
Results: FAE status varies across Europe. Current European guidelines
recommend FAEs for the initial and long-term treatment
of psoriasis. These guidelines (based on consensus/expert opinion)
also recommend a gradual increase in dose.[2] Country-specific
guidelines vary in their individual recommendations. German
guidelines endorse FAEs as 1st-line treatment for moderate-tosevere
psoriasis, based on BSA > 10% or a PASI score of > 10,
and recommend clinical assessments after 16–24 weeks of treatment.[
3] UK guidelines approve FAEs only as a 2nd-line option
for severe plaque psoriasis (PASI ≥10 or DLQI≥ 10),[1] whilst in
the Netherlands FAEs are indicated only for initial treatment of
moderate-to-severe disease.[4] Swiss guidelines also recommend
the use of FAEs for moderate-to-severe psoriasis, but only in
patients who are unresponsive to topical therapy.[5] In Sweden,
FAEs can be considered as a 2nd-line treatment option.[6]
Other country-specific guidelines are less clear. While Spanish
guidelines discuss FAEs as a slower-acting therapy requiring
treatment goals to be set at week 16, no specific guidance on the
use of FAEs is given.[7] Likewise, while Italian guidelines mention
FAEs, they are not included in treatment recommendations as
they are currently not licensed in Italy.[8] In contrast, there is no
mention of FAEs in guidelines in Denmark, Portugal and Norway.
Conclusion: European guidelines recommend FAEs for both the

initial and long-term treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis.
In Germany, FAEs have been licensed for > 20 years and are
commonly used as 1st-line therapy. In the rest of Europe, there
is growing acceptance of FAEs as a systemic therapy option in
moderate-to-severe disease. Guidelines continue to evolve as experience
grows outside Germany, and will need to be updated to
guide the use of the newly approved DMF monotherapy in future.

Introduction: Enthesitis, one of the key features of psoriatic
arthritis (PsA), shows chronicity in 50–70% of affected patients
(pts).1 Secukinumab (SEC), a fully human monoclonal antibody
that selectively neutralises IL-17A, provided significant and sustained
improvement in the signs and symptoms of active PsA, with
sustained resolution of enthesitis in Phase 3 studies.2,3
Objectives: To evaluate the effect of SEC on resolution of enthesitis
count (EC; defined by Leeds Enthesitis Index) in PsA pts using
pooled data from two Phase 3 studies, FUTURE 2 (NCT01752634)
and FUTURE 3 (NCT01989468).
Methods: SEC and placebo (PBO) were administered weekly
during the first 4 weeks (wks) followed by subcutaneous maintenance
dosing every 4 weeks thereafter (PBO until Wk 16/24). The
results are reported only for SEC 300 and 150 mg (approved doses).
Pts with baseline (BL) enthesitis (BLE) or without BLE (No
BLE) were included. Evaluation through Wk 104 included: time
to first resolution of enthesitis (i.e. EC = 0); shift analysis of BL
EC (1, 2 or 3–6) to full resolution (FR) and partial resolution (PR;
reduction of EC) at Wks 24 and 104; and number of new enthesitis
sites developed in No BLE pts. Data are as observed in the overall
population; time to first resolution of enthesitis was analysed in
the overall population and by prior use of tumour necrosis factor
inhibitor (TNFi-naïve and -inadequate responders [IR]).
Results: A total of 466 pts had BLE with a mean EC of 3.1±1.6,
and 246 pts had no BLE. Median days to resolution of EC in BLE
pts for SEC 300, 150 mg and PBO groups were 57, 85 and 167 in
overall population; 57, 85 and 120 in TNFi-naïve pts; and 92, 82
and 169 in TNFi-IR pts, respectively. In pts with BL EC = 1/2,
72%/61% (SEC 300 mg), 71%/66% (SEC 150 mg) and 45%/44%
(PBO), respectively, achieved FR at Wk 24, with FR in SEC groups
sustained or increased to 77%/81% (SEC 300 mg) and 75%/88%
(SEC 150 mg) at Wk 104. In BL EC = 3–6, 81% (SEC 300 mg),
73% (SEC 150 mg) and 71% (PBO) of pts achieved FR and PR
at Wk 24, with an increase of FR and PR to 88% (in both SEC
300 and 150 mg) at Wk 104. A total of 89% of pts with No BLE
did not develop enthesitis by Wk 104.
Conclusions: Time to resolution of enthesitis was earlier with SEC
than PBO in the overall population, with faster resolution observed
in TNFi-naïve than TNFi-IR pts. Majority of SEC-treated pts with
BL EC = 1/2 had FR by Wk 24, with further an improvement
by Wk 104. In pts with BL EC = 3–6, greater improvement was
observed with SEC 300 mg vs PBO in the proportion of pts with
FR and PR of enthesitis at Wk 24; further improvements were
observed in both SEC groups at Wk 104.

Introduction: Adalimumab is an anti–tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α) agent indicated for the treatment of immune-mediated
diseases. The long-term safety of adalimumab was previously
reported in 23,458 patients representing up to 12 years of clinical
trial exposure in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic
arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA),
plaque psoriasis (Ps), and Crohn’s disease (CD).
Objectives: Here we report an updated analysis examining the
long-term safety of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, AS,
non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA), peripheral
SpA (pSpA), PsA, Ps, hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), CD, ulcerative
colitis (UC), and non-infectious uveitis (UV).
Methods: Safety data from 78 clinical trials of adalimumab (RA,
33; AS, 5; nr-axSpA, 2; pSpA, 1; PsA, 3; Ps, 13; HS, 3; CD, 11;
UC, 4; UV, 2; other, 1) were included in these analyses, including
randomized controlled, open-label, and long-term extension studies
conducted in Europe, North America, South America, Asia,
Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa through December
31, 2016. Adalimumab postmarketing surveillance data were not
included in this analysis. Safety assessments included all adverse
events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) that occurred after the first
adalimumab study dose and up to 70 days (5 half-lives) after the
last study dose.
Results: This analysis included 29,987 patients, representing 56,951
patient-years of exposure. The majority of adalimumab exposure
was in RA studies (37,106 PYs). The most frequently reported SAE
of interest was infection (highest incidences in CD: 6.9, UV: 4.1,
RA: 3.9, and UC: 3.5). The overall standardized mortality ratio was
0.65, 95% CI [0.5, 0.74]. For most of the adalimumab populations
(AS, PsA, Ps, UC, CD, and RA), the observed number of deaths
was below what would be expected in an age- and sexadjusted population.
For HS, nr-axSpA, pSpA, and UV studies, the small size
of these trials precluded accurate assessment of the standardized
mortality ratio, and the 95% CIs all included 1.0.
Conclusion: This analysis of data from clinical trials of adalimumab
demonstrated an overall safety profile consistent with
previous findings and with the TNF inhibitor class. No new safety
signals or tolerability issues with adalimumab treatment were
identified and, for most indications, the mortality rate was below
what would be expected in an age- and sexadjusted population.
Efficacy and safety data continue to support the well-established
benefits of adalimumab for the approved indications.

Objective:To evaluate the levels of response to guselkumab
(GUS) among adalimumab (ADA) PASI 90 non-responders in
the VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2 trials.
Materials/Methods: In VOYAGE 1 (n = 837), patients were randomized
to GUS 100 mg at Weeks (Wks) 0/4/12, then every 8 wks;
placebo (PBO) at Wks 0/4/12 followed by GUS 100 mg at Wks
16/20 and then every 8 wks; or ADA 80 mg at Wk 0, 40 mg at Wk
1, and 40 mg every 2 wks through Wk 47. In VOYAGE 2 (n = 992),
patients were randomized to GUS 100 mg at Wks 0/4/12/20; PBO
at Wks 0/4/12 then GUS 100 mg at Wks 16/20; or ADA 80 mg at
Wk 0, 40 mg at W1, and then every 2 wks through Wk 23. ADA
PASI 90 non-responders initiated GUS at Wk 52 (VOYAGE 1) or
at Wk 28 (VOYAGE 2) and continued GUS treatment through Wk
100. Here we report PASI 100, PASI 90, IGA 0 (cleared) and IGA
0/1 (cleared/minimal disease), Dermatology Quality of Life Index
(DLQI), and Psoriasis Symptom and Sign Diary (PSSD) outcomes
among these ADA PASI 90 non-responders after initiating GUS
treatment through Wk 100.
Results: In VOYAGE 1, among 138 ADA-treated PASI 90 nonresponders
who initiated GUS treatment at Wk 52, a PASI 90
response was achieved by 75.0% of patients at Wk 76, and 72.6%
of patients at Wk 100. At Wk 100, 78.5% of patients achieved an
IGA 0/1 response, 74.8% of patients reported a DLQI 0/1 score,
33.3% of patients reported a PSSD symptom score of 0, and
18.9% reported a PSSD sign score of 0. In VOYAGE 2, among
112 ADA-treated PASI 90 non-responders who initiated GUS at
Wk 28, a PASI 90 response was achieved by 66.1% of patients
at Wk 48 and 75.5% of patients at Wk 100. At Wk 100, 81.0% of
patients achieved an IGA 0/1 response, 65.3% of patients reported
a DLQI 0/1 score, 32.6% of patients reported a PSSD symptom
score of 0, and patients 18.0% reported a PSSD sign score of 0.
Conclusions: Among ADA PASI 90 non-responders, GUS treatment
provided robust levels of efficacy, which were maintained
through Wk 100.

Objective:To evaluate the consistency of response of guselkumab
(GUS) across predetermined weight quartile subgroups of
psoriasis patients.
Materials/Methods: In VOYAGE 1 (n = 837) and VOYAGE 2
(n = 992), patients were randomized to GUS 100 mg at Weeks
0/4/12/20; placebo (PBO) at Weeks 0/4/12 followed by GUS 100
mg at Weeks 16/20; or ADA 80 mg at Week 0, 40 mg at Week
1, and 40 mg every 2 weeks through Week 23. The co-primary
endpoints were the proportions of GUS vs PBO patients achieving:
1) ≥90% improvement in PASI score (PASI 90), and 2) cleared/
minimal disease (IGA 0/1) responses at Week 16. Response rates
across endpoints were evaluated for predetermined subgroups by
baseline weight quartiles.
Results: Pooled data from the two studies at Week 16 and Week 24
demonstrated that patients in the guselkumab group achieved substantially
higher clinical responses compared with placebo at Week
16 and ADA at Week 24 across all quartiles of weight as cutoffs.
At Week 16, for each quartile, defined by < 74.6, ≥74.6– < 86.4,
≥86.4– < 100, and ≥100 kg, the proportions of GUS patients with
a PASI 90 response were 76.0%, 78.6%, 66.2%, and 65.2%,
respectively and the proportions with an IGA 0/1 response were
89.1%, 88.6%, 78.7%, and 82.6%, respectively. The proportions
of PBO patients with a PASI 90 response by these quartiles were
5.0%, 2.9%, 1.2%, and 0.9%, respectively and the proportions
with an IGA 0/1 response were 11.6%, 10.5%, 4.9%, and 3.5%,
respectively.
At Week 24, the proportions of GUS patients with a PASI 90 response
by weight quartile were 79.7%, 81.1%, 75.1%, and 73.4%,
respectively and the proportions with an IGA 0/1 response were
85.9%, 88.1%, 83.1%, and 78.3%, respectively. The proportions
of ADA patients with a PASI 90 response by these quartiles were
62.4%, 66.0%, 52.7%, and 35.5%, respectively and the proportions
with an IGA 0/1 response were 70.9%, 76.5%, 61.1%, and
45.2%, respectively.
Conclusions: The efficacy of GUS treatment was demonstrated
across all predefined weight quartiles and high efficacy responses
were observed in psoriasis patients without regard to weight.

Introduction: Evidence suggests that timely and effective management
can improve long-term outcomes in patients (pts) with
psoriatic arthritis (PsA); however factors influencing treatment
management decisions are not well understood.
Objective:To evaluate the association between the clinical specialty
setting and time from inflammatory musculoskeletal symptom
onset to PsA diagnosis and to different management steps in pts
with a diagnosis of PsA.
Methods: LOOP is a large cross-sectional, multi-center, observational
study conducted in 17 countries across Western and Eastern
Europe, Latin America, and Asia. Adult pts (≥18 years) with a
suspected or an established diagnosis of PsA routinely visiting a
rheumatologist (rheum), dermatologist (derm) or non-rheum/nonderm
site were eligible to participate in this study. Each enrolled
patient in the study was assessed by both rheum and derm. Main
endpoints assessed were time from inflammatory musculoskeletal
symptom onset to PsA diagnosis, time from PsA diagnosis to first
csDMARD and to first bDMARD, and time from first csDMARD
to first bDMARD.
Results: Of the 1483 pts enrolled in this study, 1273 pts with a
confirmed diagnosis of PsA were included in this analysis. A maPoster
abstracts 21
Acta Derm Venereol 2018
jority of pts were recruited by rheums (671, 52.7%), followed by
derms (541, 42.5%), physiatrists (36, 2.8%), and other specialties
(25, 2.0%). PsA was first suspected by a rheum in 726 (57.0%) pts
and by a derm in 541 pts (42.5%). Pt demographics and disease
characteristics were mostly comparable between rheum and derm
settings. Disease activity was higher in PsA pts in derm setting
compared with rheum setting. The mean time from symptom onset
to PsA diagnosis was 24 months (mo) in rheum setting and 1 mo
longer for derms. In rheum and derm settings, the mean time from
PsA diagnosis to first csDMARD were 11 and 25 mo, respectively;
whereas the mean time to first bDMARD were 52 and 55 mo, respectively.
The mean time from first csDMARD to first bDMARD
was 42 mo for rheums; while it was 3 months shorter for derms.
Conclusion: Although the duration from symptom onset to PsA
diagnosis was similar between rheum and derm setting, there were
differences in the timing of introduction of different DMARD
classes. Notably, mean time to first csDMARD was significantly
shorter in rheum setting. PsA pts in derm setting had significantly
higher disease activity. These data lend further support to the need
for rheum-derm collaborative approach to optimize management
of pts with PsA.

Background: VOYAGE 1 and 2 were two phase 3 double-blinded,
placebo/active comparator-controlled trials evaluating guselkumab
(GUS), a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin
(IL)-23, compared with adalimumab (ADA) in the treatment of
patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Here, we report
speed of response results based on Psoriasis Area and Severity
Index (PASI) outcomes through Week 24 from pooled VOYAGE
1 and 2 data.
Methods: In VOYAGE 1 and 2, patients with plaque psoriasis
were randomized at baseline to GUS 100 mg (Weeks 0 and 4, then
every 8 weeks [q8w]; pooled n = 825), ADA (80 mg Week 0, 40
mg Week 1, then 40 mg every 2 weeks [q2w]; pooled n = 582), or
placebo (Weeks 0, 4, and 12, then GUS 100 mg at Weeks 16 and
20; pooled n = 422). Efficacy was evaluated using PASI 75, PASI
90, and PASI 100 responses (patients achieving ≥75%, ≥90%, and
100% PASI improvement from baseline, respectively) through
Week 24. Median time to achieve a response was defined as the
time taken for ≥50% of the patients to ever achieve a response.
Results: Based on the pooled VOYAGE 1 and 2 data, median
time to achieve a PASI 75 response was ≤ 8 weeks for both the
GUS and ADA groups. However, median time to achieve a PASI
90 response was ≤ 12 weeks for GUS and ≤ 16 weeks for ADA.
Median time to achieve a PASI 100 response was ≤ 24 weeks for
GUS, but was not achieved for ADA. Median time to achieve any
defined endpoint was not achieved for the placebo group.
Conclusions: Taken together, these results demonstrate that patients
with moderate-to-severe psoriasis treated with GUS rapidly
achieved high levels of response, and more efficiently and more
quickly than with ADA.

Introduction: The Fc-free, PEGylated, anti-tumor necrosis factor
certolizumab pegol (CZP) has shown efficacy in chronic plaque
psoriasis (PSO) over 48 weeks’ treatment.[1,2]
Objectives: To report 48-week safety data for CZP in PSO.
Methods: Data were pooled from ongoing phase 3 trials of CZP
in adults with PSO (n = 962): CIMPASI-1 (NCT02326298), CIMPASI-
2 (NCT02326272), CIMPACT (NCT02346240). Patients
(pts) had PSO ≥6 months (Psoriasis Area Severity Index ≥12,
≥10% body surface area affected, physician’s global assessment
≥3/5) and were randomized to CZP 400 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W)
or 200 mg Q2W (400 mg loading dose at Weeks 0/2/4), placebo
(PBO) for 16 weeks, or etanercept for 12 weeks (CIMPACT
only). We present data for pts receiving ≥1 CZP dose during initial
and/or maintenance periods with up to 48 weeks’ exposure as of
20Oct2016 (CIMPASI-1), 16Aug2016 (CIMPASI-2), 05Dec2016
(CIMPACT). Adverse events (AEs) were classified using Med-
DRAv18.1. Incidence rates (IR) are the incidence of new cases
per 100 patient-years (PY).
Results: Total CZP exposure was 730PY. 709 pts (73.7%) experienced
≥1 AE; IRs were similar between pts receiving CZP
200 mg Q2W and 400 mg Q2W (Table 1). Rates of serious AEs
were low, including infections and infestations (Table 1). There
were 4 malignancies (1 anaplastic oligodendroglioma, 2 basal
cell carcinoma, 1 keratoacanthoma), 1 congestive heart failure, 1
death (motor vehicle accident) and 1 case of primary progressive
multiple sclerosis, all reported in patients receiving CZP 400 mg
Q2W. AE IR did not increase with exposure duration, and at Week
16 was comparable for CZP and PBO pts (Table 2).
Conclusion: CZP safety was as expected for this therapeutic class
in PSO and there were no new safety signals.

Introduction: DAPSA and MDA are validated composite indices
used in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) to measure disease activity states (1).
Objectives: To assess the proportion of pts treated with secukinumab
(SEC) reaching DAPSA remission (REM) or low disease
activity (LDA) and those who reached either MDA or very low
disease activity (VLDA) at Weeks (wks) 16 and 104 in the FUTURE
2 study (2).
Methods: DAPSA-REM, DAPSA-REM/LDA, MDA, and VLDA
and their core components were assessed in the overall population
and in pts stratified by prior anti-TNF use (TNF-Naïve/IR) and time
since first PsA diagnosis ( ≤ 2/ > 2 years) using as observed data.
Results: At Wk16, in the overall population, the proportion of pts
treated with SEC 300/150 mg achieving remission was 14%/10%
(DAPSA-REM) and 8%/6% (VLDA) and achieving LDA was
42%/44% (DAPSA-REM/LDA) and 28%/23% (MDA). A higher
proportion of anti-TNF-naïve pts and pts with early diagnosis ( ≤ 2
years) treated with SEC achieved and sustained DAPSA-REM/
LDA and MDA than in the overall population (Table). DAPSAREM/
LDA and MDA responses with SEC were sustained through
Wk104.
Conclusions: In the overall population, a higher proportion
of SEC treated pts at Wk16 achieved DAPSA-REM, VLDA,
DAPSA-REM/LDA, and MDA than those treated with placebo
with a greater number of pts achieving DAPSA-REM or LDA than
VLDA or MDA, respectively. These responses were sustained
through Wk104.

Introduction: Efficacy of tildrakizumab (TIL), a high affinity,
humanized, immunoglobulin G1κ monoclonal antibody against
interleukin-23p19, has been evaluated for chronic plaque psoriasis
(PsO) in 2 phase 3 randomized controlled trials.
Objective:The aim of our analysis was to determine predictors of
response to TIL treatment in the 2 trials.
Methods: Patients (pts) with moderate to severe PsO were
randomized in reSURFACE 1 (phase 3; NCT01722331) and
reSURFACE 2 (phase 3; NCT01729754) [1]. In Part 1 (Week
[W]1–W12), pts received subcutaneous TIL 200 mg, TIL 100 mg,
or placebo (PBO) at W0 and W4. Pts receiving PBO in Part 1 were
rerandomized to TIL 200 mg or 100 mg in Part 2 (W12–W28). For
each trial, continuous variables of mean baseline Psoriasis Area
and Severity Index (PASI), body mass index (BMI), Physician’s
Global Assessment (PGA), and PASI component for head region
as well as dichotomous variables of baseline PASI > 20 or ≤ 20
and PASI 50 response or nonresponse at W8 were evaluated as
predictors of response. Response was defined in this analysis as
PASI 50 or PASI 90 at W12 and W28.
Results: None of the continuous variables appeared to be consistently
predictive of PASI 50 or PASI 90 response, nor were baseline
PASI > 20 or ≤ 20 definitive predictors of response. PASI 50 response
vs nonresponse at W8 with TIL 200 mg appeared to be predictive
of a PASI 50 response at W12 (percentage of patients±SD:
98%±0.9% vs 59%±6.1%, respectively, in reSURFACE 1, and
99%±0.8% vs 57%±5.7%, respectively, in reSURFACE 2) and of
a PASI 90 response at W12 (47%±3.3% vs 0%±0%, respectively,
in reSURFACE 1, and 50%±3.3% vs 5%±2.6%, respectively, in
reSURFACE 2). The percentage of patients with PASI 50 response
vs nonresponse at W8 with TIL 200 mg who achieved PASI 50 by
W28 was 99%±0.6% vs 90%±3.8%, respectively, in reSURFACE
1, and 99%±0.8% vs 86%±4.0%, respectively, in reSURFACE 2;
the percentage who achieved PASI 90 by W28 was 70%±3.1%
vs 23%±5.4%, respectively, in reSURFACE 1, and 70%±3.1%
vs 21%±4.7%, respectively, in reSURFACE 2. Similar trends in
predictive responses were observed with TIL 100-mg treatment.
Conclusions: Achievement of PASI 50 by W8 was predictive of
a PASI 50 and PASI 90 response at W12 and W28. Most of the
patients who had not achieved PASI 50 by W8 were able to achieve
a PASI 50 response by W28. Baseline PASI score, PGA, and BMI
were not predictive of PASI 50 or PASI 90 response.

Objective:To report long-term efficacy of guselkumab (GUS) after
drug withdrawal and retreatment in patients with moderate-severe
psoriasis (PsO) in the Phase 3 VOYAGE 2 study.
Methods: At Wk28, patients initially randomized to GUS who
achieved a PASI90 response were re-randomized to either PBO/
withdrawal (with retreatment upon loss of ≥50% PASI improvement
achieved at Wk28 or at Wk72 if retreatment criteria were
not met) or continued GUS treatment through Wk72.
Results: Among 375 patients initially randomized to GUS who
achieved a PASI90 response at Wk28, 182 were re-randomized
to PBO/withdrawal and 193 to GUS/maintenance treatment. Efficacy
for the continued GUS treatment group was maintained
through Wk72, while responses for the withdrawal group diminished,
with PASI90 responses of 86.0% vs 11.5% respectively at
Poster abstracts 23
Acta Derm Venereol 2018
Wk72. Among the 182 patients in the withdrawal arm, 117 were
retreated with GUS prior to Wk72; 56 did not meet retreatment
criteria and initiated retreatment at Wk72 per protocol. Of 173
patients retreated, 87.6% achieved PASI90 within 6 months of
commencing retreatment. No new safety signals were observed
with GUS withdrawal and retreatment through Wk100. Maintenance
of PASI90 response after drug withdrawal was associated
with continued suppression of IL-17A, IL-17F, & IL-22, while
loss of response was associated with increased levels of these
circulating cytokines.
Conclusion: Superior maintenance of high efficacy response rates
was achieved with continuous GUS treatment vs withdrawal, and
the majority of retreated patients achieved PASI90. Maintenance
of PASI90 after drug withdrawal was associated with continued
suppression of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22.

Background: Various instruments are currently used for disease
activity and outcome assessment in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Some
measures attempt to incorporate the total spectrum of psoriatic
disease manifestations [eg, minimal disease activity (MDA)] while
others focus on arthritis assessments [eg, disease activity index
for PsA (DAPSA)]. Whether in patients (pts) with PsA it is sufficient
to primarily consider joint disease aspects remains unclear.
Objective:To compare DAPSA remission and low disease activity
(LDA) with MDA and very low disease activity (VLDA) for the
presence of residual abnormalities of the respective composing
variables.
Methods: This post hoc analysis included pts with PsA receiving
adalimumab (ADA) in one of two multicenter studies: ADEPT was
a 24-week (wk), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial; ACCLAIM was a 12-wk, open-label study conducted in
Canada in care settings that reflected usual practice. Frequencies
of DAPSA remission/LDA and MDA/VLDA were summarized,
and the individual PsA manifestations within these states were
assessed. DAPSA was summed from the following continuous
variables: swollen (66) and tender (68) joints, pt global assessment
(PtGA, cm), pt pain (PP, cm), and C-reactive protein (CRP,
mg/dL). DAPSA remission was defined as ≤ 4 and DAPSA LDA
as > 4 and ≤ 14. MDA criteria were as follows: ≤ 1 tender, ≤ 1
swollen joint, ≤ 1 entheseal point, PP ≤ 15mm, PtGA ≤ 20mm,
HAQ ≤ 0.5, and PASI ≤ 3. MDA was calculated as fulfilling 5
of the 7 criteria, and VLDA calculated as fulfilling all 7 criteria.
Data were as observed.
Results: Among 151 pts receiving ADA in ADEPT, 33 (22%) each
achieved DAPSA remission and LDA at wk 24, and 20 (14%) and
11 (7%) achieved MDA and VLDA, respectively. Pts achieving
DAPSA LDA appeared to mirror those in MDA, with the exception
of experiencing numerically higher PP, PtGA, and PASI scores
at wk 24. Pts in DAPSA LDA did experience numerically lower
SJC when compared with the MDA achievers, and, like MDA
achievers, displayed little residual enthesitis. Only VLDA, but not
MDA, could match the stringency of DAPSA remission, a finding
that was confirmed through analysis of the ACCLAIM cohort.
However, VLDA allowed for numerically higher residual PP and
PtGA levels when compared with DAPSA remission. Importantly,
residual enthesitis did not differ among pts achieving DAPSA
remission or VLDA. Irrespective of disease activity assessment,
pts receiving ADA displayed little to no radiographic progression.
Conclusions: In the ADEPT and ACCLAIM cohorts, pts who
achieved DAPSA remission or VLDA demonstrated similar
outcomes with respect to the individual components of both scores,
despite the omission of several of these within the DAPSA.
Given the DAPSA’s continuous nature, its use may offer a good
alternative to fulfillment of the VLDA criteria, but these results
require confirmation in different pt populations.

Introduction: Ixekizumab (IXE), an interleukin-17A antagonist,
was superior to placebo (PBO) in improving the signs and symptoms
of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) at Week 24 in biologic-naïve
patients (pts).
Objective:To determine the efficacy and safety of IXE treatment
up to 3 years in biologic-naïve pts with PsA. Methods: In the
SPIRIT-P1 Phase 3 trial (NCT01695239), 210 pts were randomized
to IXE (80 mg every 4 [Q4W] or 2 [Q2W] weeks), 101 pts to
adalimumab (active reference arm), and 106 pts to PBO at Week
0. ADA and PBO patients were re-randomized to IXE at the end
of the double-blind treatment period. Ad-hoc efficacy for all pts
initially randomized to IXE (intent-to-treat [ITT]) is presented.
Modified non-responder imputation (missing data considered nonresponse
for pts discontinued due to lack of efficacy or adverse
events [AEs]; multiple imputation for all other missing data) was
applied to efficacy response outcomes. Ad hoc safety data, for all
pts who received at least one IXE dose during the trial (n = 386),
are presented as exposure-adjusted incidence rates (IRs; number
of pts with events*100 /total pt years [PY]).
Results: Efficacy results are summarized for ITT IXE-treated pts
(Table 1). Improvements in ACR (American College of Rheumatology)
responses, enthesitis, dactylitis, PASI (Psoriasis Area
and Severity Index), and NAPSI (Nail Psoriasis Severity Index)
persisted up to 3 years. Safety assessments for all pts initially
randomized to IXE or re-randomized to IXE during SPIRIT-P1 are
summarized (Table 2). IRs of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs)
were similar between IXE Q4W and Q2W treatment groups.

Introduction: Tildrakizumab is a high-affinity, humanized, immunoglobulin
G1κ monoclonal antibody against interleukin-23p19
for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis.
Objectives: We evaluated gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE)
and, specifically, cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; ie,
Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis) in the clinical development
program for tildrakizumab.
Methods: Patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis
were randomized in 3 large clinical trials: P05495 (phase 2;
NCT01225731), reSURFACE 1 (phase 3; NCT01722331), and
reSURFACE 2 (phase 3; NCT01729754) [1,2]. In this post hoc
analysis, we sought to identify serious GI AEs and new-onset
or exacerbation of pre-existing IBD from a pooled dataset of
tildrakizumab-treated patients from these 3 trials, which followed
patients up to 52 (reSURFACE 2) or 64 (reSURFACE 1) weeks.
This analysis evaluated patients who received tildrakizumab 100
mg and 200 mg in P05495 and the reSURFACE trials.
Results: In this analysis, we pooled 1911 patients from the 3 trials
who received either tildrakizumab 100 or 200 mg. There were no
new cases of IBD reported; among 6 patients with a history of IBD
randomized to tildrakizumab, none experienced an exacerbation.
The numbers (rate per 100 patient-years) of patients with serious
GI AEs in the pooled dataset were 8 (0.80) for tildrakizumab 100
mg and 4 (0.43) for tildrakizumab 200 mg. These serious GI AEs
included abdominal pain, constipation, diverticulum, dyspepsia,
gastritis, thrombosed hemorrhoids, esophageal polyp, pancreatitis
(1 patient each) among patients treated with tildrakizumab 100 mg,
and abdominal hernia, upper abdominal pain, acute pancreatitis,
and salivary gland enlargement (1 patient each) among patients
treated with tildrakizumab 200 mg.
Conclusion: In this post hoc analysis of patients from 3 large,
randomized clinical trials, serious GI AEs were infrequent and
there were no new cases of IBD or exacerbations of IBD.

Introduction: Certolizumab pegol (CZP), an Fc-free, PEGylated,
anti-tumor necrosis factor, has shown efficacy in chronic plaque
psoriasis (PSO).[1,2]
Objectives: To assess the proportions of patients (pts) achieving
selected PASI thresholds over 48 weeks of CZP treatment.
Methods: Data were pooled from CIMPASI-1 (NCT02326298)
and CIMPASI-2 (NCT02326272), ongoing phase 3 trials in adults
with moderate to severe PSO ≥6 months (Psoriasis Area Severity
Index [PASI] ≥12, ≥10% body surface area affected, physician’s
global assessment ≥3/5). Pts were randomized 2:2:1 to CZP 400
mg every 2 weeks (Q2W), 200 mg Q2W (400 mg loading dose
[LD] at Weeks 0/2/4), or placebo (PBO). Week 16 PASI 50 responders
receiving CZP continued the same dose to Week 48. We
present the proportions of patients reaching PASI ≤ 1, 2, 3 and 5 at
Weeks 16 and 48. Responder rate estimates were calculated using
a logistic regression model. Pts not achieving PASI 50 at Weeks
16/32/40/48 were subsequently classed as non-responders. Other
missing data were imputed using multiple imputation (Markov
Chain Monte Carlo method).
Results: At Week 0, 175, 186 and 100 pts were randomized to
CZP 400 mg Q2W, CZP 200 mg Q2W, and PBO. Baseline mean
PASI was comparable across CZP 400 mg Q2W/CZP 200 mg
Q2W/PBO pts: 19.6 (SD:7.3)/19.2 (7.2)/18.6 (6.6). At Week 16,
PASI ≤ 1 was achieved by 39.9% pts receiving CZP 400 mg Q2W
and 36.2% CZP 200 mg pts, vs 2.6% PBO pts. Similarly, a higher
proportion of CZP vs PBO pts achieved PASI ≤ 2, PASI ≤ 3 and
PASI ≤ 5 (Table). In CZP-treated pts, PASI was maintained or
further reduced to Week 48, with 48.2% CZP 400 mg Q2W pts
and 39.9% CZP 200 mg Q2W pts achieving PASI ≤ 1 after 48
weeks’ treatment (Table).
Conclusions: Higher proportions of CZP vs PBO pts met absolute
PASI cut-offs over 16 weeks and response was maintained
or further improved to Week 48. Although durability of response
was observed with both doses, higher proportions of pts treated
with CZP 400 mg Q2W than 200 mg Q2W were able to reach the
most stringent cut-offs at Week 48.

Acta Derm Venereol 2018
anti–interleukin-23p19 monoclonal antibody that demonstrated
efficacy in phase 3 trials in moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis
(reSURFACE 1 [NCT01722331] and 2 [NCT01729754]) [1].
Objective:Here we investigated the relationship between TIL
serum concentration, and efficacy and safety outcomes, in re-
SURFACE 1 and 2.
Methods: Placebo or TIL 100 mg or 200 mg was administered at
Weeks 0 and 4, then every 12 weeks. Endpoints included proportion
of patients achieving 75% Psoriasis Area and Severity Index
(PASI 75) improvement from baseline (PASI 75 responders).
Pooled efficacy data for each dose from reSURFACE 1 and 2
were grouped into quartiles based on average (mean) serum TIL
concentration during Weeks 0–12 (Cav12). Associations between
median Cav12 for each quartile (Q) and TIL dose were analyzed
for PASI 75 response at Week 12 and adverse events (AEs).
Results: TIL steady-state concentrations were achieved by Week
16 and were proportional to the dose administered. Median Cav12
(range) for TIL Q1–Q4, respectively, were 4.4 (2.1–5.2), 5.7
(5.2–6.4), 7.0 (6.4–7.8), and 8.7 (7.8–16.1) μg/mL for TIL 100 mg
(n = 616) and 8.7 (4.2–10.4), 11.5 (10.4–12.5), 14.1 (12.5–15.5),
and 17.3 (15.5–30.6) μg/mL for TIL 200 mg (n = 622). PASI
responses were similar for corresponding quartiles across doses,
with no relationship between serum concentration and patient
response for Q1–Q3. Greater PASI 75 responses were associated
with the highest Cav12 (Q4), particularly for TIL 100 mg where
PASI 75 response rates (95% confidence intervals [CI]) were
58.4% (54.6, 62.3), 62.3% (58.4, 66.1), 59.2% (55.3, 63.1), and
73.7% (70.1, 77.0) for Q1–Q4, respectively. Corresponding PASI
75 rates (95% CIs) for patients receiving 200 mg were 52.9% (49.0,
56.8), 68.6% (64.9, 72.2), 64.5% (60.6, 68.1), and 74.8% (71.2,
78.0) over Q1–Q4. There were no associations between AE rates
and serum concentrations, and incidence rates of any AE, any
infections, serious infections, upper respiratory tract infections,
malignancies, non-melanoma skin cancer, confirmed extended
major cardiovascular events, and drug-related hypersensitivity
for TIL-treated patients were similar to, or less than, for placebotreated
patients.
Conclusions: No relationship was apparent between TIL dose or
Cav12 and PASI response, although the greatest response was
seen for the highest serum concentration. Importantly, there were
no associations between serum concentration and AE incidence.

Introduction: We evaluated long-term (up to 52 weeks) safety and
efficacy of originator adalimumab every-other-week treatment
(ADA eow) for fingernail psoriasis (Ps) in patients (pts) with
moderate-to-severe Ps with substantial, clinically impactful,
moderate-to-severe fingernail Ps.
Methods: In 26-week Period A, pts were randomized 1:1 to 40 mg
ADA after initial 80 mg dose, or matching placebo (pbo). Period
B (open-label, 26 weeks) entry criteria: completion of Period A,
or ≥25% increase from baseline in affected body surface area
(BSA) at week 16. At Period B entry (week 26), Period-A pbo pts
received an initial blinded dose of 80 mg ADA; all received ADA
eow from weeks 27 through 51. We analyzed all pts who received
ADA throughout the 52 weeks. Efficacy is reported using multiple
imputation (MI) for missing data, and as observed results.
Results: Of the 217 randomized pts, 203 received at ≥1 dose of
ADA, 188 entered Period B, and 168 completed the trial. Of those
receiving continuous ADA treatment through 52 weeks (n = 109),
response rates (MI) for key efficacy outcomes at weeks 26 and 52,
respectively, were as follows. ≥75% improvement from baseline in
modified Nail Ps Severity Index (mNAPSI 75): 47.4% and 54.5%.
Physician’s Global Assessment of fingernail Ps of 0 (clear) or 1
(minimal) with ≥2 grades improvement from baseline (PGA-F
0/1): 51.1% and 55.6%. Mean change (improvement) from baseline
in nail Ps pain (numerical rating scale [NRS]): 3.6 and 3.8.
Mean change (improvement) from baseline in Nail Ps Physical
Functioning Severity score (NPPFS): 3.4 and 3.9. Mean change
(improvement) from baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index
score (DLQI): 9.1 and 9.0 (n = 94).
As observed response rates at weeks 26 and 52 respectively, were
as follows. mNAPSI 75: 47/88 (53.4%) and 52/80 (65.0%). PGA-F
0/1: 48/88 (54.5%) and 49/80 (61.3%). Mean change (improvement)
from baseline in nail Ps pain (NRS): 3.8 (n = 92) and 4.4
(n = 80). Mean change (improvement) from baseline in NPPFS:
3.9 (n = 92) and 4.4 (n = 80). Mean change (improvement) from
baseline in DLQI: 9.3 (n = 69) and 9.7 (n = 65).
Adverse events (AEs) per 100 pt years (E/100PYs; in 140.3 PYs)
were: any event, 352 (250.9), serious AEs, 21 (15.0); and serious
infections, 9 (6.4). AE’s were similar to those observed in phase
3 clinical trials of ADA for Ps.
Conclusion: ADA treatment of nail Ps across 52 weeks demonstrated
short- and long-term efficacy. No new safety signals were
identified in these pts receiving ≥1 dose of ADA.

Introduction: ESPRIT is a 10-year (y) international prospective
observational registry evaluating the long-term safety and effectiveness
of originator adalimumab (ADA) in adult patients (pts)
with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.
Objectives: To determine safety, effectiveness, and pt-reported
outcomes (PROs) over an 8-y period from an interim analysis of
data collected from the ESPRIT registry.
Methods: ESPRIT enrolled pts who were continuing ADA treatment
from a current prescription or previous study participation, or
initiating ADA ≤ 4 weeks of entering the registry. The All-Treated
pt population (All-Rx) received at least 1 ADA dose in this registry.
Pts were evaluated at 3 and 6 months (mos) post-enrollment, and
then every 6 mos for up to 10 ys. This interim analysis includes
data collected from 26 Sep 2008 through 30 Nov 2016. Incidence
rates (IR) for all treatment-emergent adverse events (All-TEAEs)
in All-Rx pts are reported as events per 100 pt-ys (E/100PY) of
overall exposure to ADA. Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA)
and PROs (US only) were evaluated in as-observed population
(pt numbers were small at 96 mos).
Results: For the 6045 All-Rx pts enrolled and dosed in ESPRIT,
median duration of overall exposure to ADA was 3.9 ys. Registry
discontinuation rate in All-Rx pts was 39.4%; with the most
common reason being lost to follow up (18.2%). IR (E/100PY)
for All-TEAEs was: overall 22.0; serious AEs 4.5; malignancies

1.1, serious infections 1.0; non-melanoma skin cancer 0.7; active
TB < 0.1; and All-TEAEs leading to death 0.2. Standardized
mortality ratio was 0.34 (95% CI, 0.25–0.46), indicating the observed
number of deaths was below expected in an age-, sex- and
country-matched population. PGA clear/minimal was achieved by
57.0%, 58.7%, 59.1%, 62.6%, 61.9%, 63.8%, 65.5%, and 45.0% of
pts at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 96 mos, respectively. In 4202
US pts, mean change from baseline in Dermatology Quality of
Life Index, total work productivity impairment, and total activity
impairment at 12-mo intervals were -3.1/-5.5/-8.3, -3.2/-5.4/-9.1,
-3.3/-5.3/-8.4, -3.5/-5.6/-8.7, -3.9/-5.8/-9.3, -3.7/-6.3/-8.7, -5.1/-
9.1/-11.4, and -5.9/-7.5/-13.8.
Conclusions: In this 8-y interim analysis, no new safety signals
were observed and safety was consistent with the known safety
profile of ADA. The number of TE deaths in the registry was
below the expected rate. As-observed effectiveness of ADA and
improvement from baseline in PROs were maintained through
96 mos.

Introduction: Certolizumab pegol (CZP), the only Fc-free, PEGylated,
anti-tumor necrosis factor biologic, has shown clinical
improvements and a safety profile consistent with the class in
adults with chronic plaque psoriasis (PSO).[1,2,3]
Objectives: To assess durability to Week 48 of the initial Week 16
clinical response with CZP in PSO patients (pts) in two identical
phase 3 trials.
Methods: Data were pooled from CIMPASI-1 (NCT02326298) and
CIMPASI-2 (NCT02326272), ongoing CZP phase 3 trials in adults
with PSO ≥6 months (Psoriasis Area Severity Index [PASI] ≥12,
≥10% body surface area affected, physician’s global assessment
[PGA] ≥3/5). Pts were randomized 2:2:1 to CZP 400 mg every
two weeks (Q2W), 200 mg Q2W (400 mg loading dose [LD] at
Weeks 0/2/4), or placebo (PBO). At Week 16, PASI 50 responders
receiving CZP continued the same dose through the maintenance
period to Week 48. PASI 50 non-responders at Weeks 32/40/48
were classed as non-responders at subsequent time points. These
analyses do not include PBO pts or Week 16 PASI 50 non-responders.
We report number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve PASI 75
at Week 16, and PASI 75 at Week 48 in pts who achieved PASI 75
at Week 16. Week 16 NNT, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and
Week 48 PASI 75 responder rates were estimated using logistic
regression in which missing data and patients withdrawn due to
relapse ( < PASI 50 during the maintenance period) were imputed
using multiple imputation (Markov Chain Monte Carlo [MCMC]
method). Sensitivity analyses on PASI 75 were conducted using
non-responder imputation (NRI).
Results: At Week 16, NNT to achieve a PASI 75 response was 1.41
(95% CI: 1.26–1.60) for the CZP 400 mg Q2W dose group and
1.53 (1.35–1.77) for the CZP 200 mg Q2W dose group.
Of the pts randomized to CZP 400 mg Q2W and CZP 200 mg Q2W
at Week 0 who entered the blinded maintenance phase, 132/149 and
130/150 achieved PASI 75, respectively. Out of Week 16 PASI 75
responders, 98.0% of patients treated with CZP 400 mg Q2W and
87.5% of patients treated with CZP 200 mq Q2W also reported a
PASI 75 response at Week 48 (Table). Sensitivity analyses using
NRI showed similar trends with both doses, and similar trends
were seen in PASI 90 response rates.
Conclusions: These analyses show that patients in both CZP dose
groups demonstrate durability of their initial Week 16 high-level
response to Week 48, with greatest durability seen in the CZP
400 mg Q2W dose group (98.0% maintenance between Weeks
16 and 48).

Introduction: Psoriasis (Ps) disease burden for patients with psoriasis
(Ps) and concomitant fingernail Ps plus psoriatic arthritis
(PsA) is higher compared with patients with Ps alone.
Objective:We report safety and efficacy of originator adalimumab
(ADA) in patients with fingernail Ps, and also for patients with or
without concomitant PsA.
Methods: Results are reported from the double-blind PBOcontrolled,
Period A in which 217 patients with moderate to
severe plaque Ps and fingernail Ps were included and randomized
1:1 to receive 40 mg ADA every other week (eow) from week 1
(initial 80mg dose at week 0), or matching PBO, for 26 weeks.
The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with ≥75%
improvement in modified Nail Ps Severity Index (mNAPSI 75)
and the proportion of patients with Physician’s Global Assessment
of Fingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) of clear (0) or minimal
(1) with ≥2-grade reduction from baseline (primary in US only;
for regulatory purposes). Missing data were handled by multiple
imputation. Safety was assessed using treatment-emergent
adverse events (AEs).
Results: Of the 217 randomized patients (108 PBO, 109 ADA),
84.3% were male; mean age was 46.7 years; 188 (86.6%) completed
26 weeks of treatment or early escaped to Period B according
to protocol. At baseline, 28.6% had PsA (29.6% PBO, 27.5%
ADA) with mean duration 7.91 years [SD 8.314]. Total fingernail
mNAPSI 75 was achieved by 0.5% PBO vs 61.5% ADA of patients
with PsA and 4.6% PBO vs 40.9% ADA without PsA (p < 0.001
for both groups). PGA-F 0 or 1 with ≥2-grade reduction was
achieved by 4.4% PBO vs 59.3% ADA with PsA and 7.9% PBO
vs 44.9% ADA without PsA (p < 0.001 for both groups). Adverse

events (AEs) in Period A were reported by 55.6% PBO vs 56.9%
ADA (with PsA: 56.3% PBO vs 56.7% ADA; without PsA: 55.3%
PBO vs 57.0% ADA without PsA); serious AEs by 4.6% PBO vs
7.3% ADA (with PsA: 9.4% PBO vs 10.0% ADA; without PsA:
2.6% PBO vs 6.3% ADA).
Conclusions: The results demonstrated that in this population,
ADA was more effective than PBO for the treatment of fingernail
Ps, and significantly improved signs and symptoms, both overall
and regardless of the presence or abscense of PsA; no new safety
risks were identified with ADA eow treatment for 26 weeks.

Introduction: The Fc-free, PEGylated, anti-tumor necrosis factor
certolizumab pegol (CZP) has shown efficacy in chronic plaque
psoriasis (PSO). [1,2]
Objectives: To assess the efficacy of CZP to 48 weeks across
patient (pt) demographic and baseline disease characteristic subgroups
in phase 3 trials.
Methods: In this prespecified, pooled subgroup analysis, data
were pooled from CIMPASI-1 (NCT02326298) and CIMPASI-2
(NCT02326272), ongoing phase 3 trials in adults with moderate
to severe PSO ≥6 months (psoriasis area and severity index [PASI]
≥12, affected body surface area [BSA] ≥10%, physician’s global
assessment [PGA] ≥3/5). Pts were randomized 2:2:1 to CZP 400
mg every 2 weeks (Q2W), 200 mg Q2W (400 mg loading dose at
Weeks 0/2/4), or placebo (PBO). At Week 16, PASI 50 responders
receiving CZP continued the same dose through the maintenance
period to Week 48. PASI 50 nonresponders at Weeks 32/40/48 were
classed as nonresponders at subsequent time points. Subgroups
included age, weight, body mass index (BMI), baseline PASI, BSA
and PSO duration. PASI 75, PGA 0/1, and PASI 90 responder rates
were summarized at Week 16 using a logistic regression model
with multiple imputation (overall population) and descriptively at
Week 48 based on nonresponse imputation (subgroups).
Results: 175/186/100 pts received CZP 400 mg Q2W/CZP 200
mg Q2W/PBO. Efficacy was observed across all subgroups for
both CZP 400 mg Q2W and 200 mg Q2W, with higher Week 48
PASI 75 responder rates in CZP 400 mg Q2W vs CZP 200 mg
Q2W treated pts (Table). Similar trends were observed for PGA
0/1 and PASI 90.
Conclusions: Treatment with either dose of CZP resulted in
clinically meaningful improvements in signs and symptoms of
PSO at Week 16 maintained at Week 48. Similar to the overall
population, PASI 75, PGA 0/1, and PASI 90 responder rates were
greater for CZP 400 mg Q2W versus 200 mg Q2W across most
subgroups at Week 48.

DISCONTINUATION OF BIOLOGIC THERAPIES IN
CHRONIC PLAQUE PSORIASIS: A RETROSPECTIVE
COHORT

Introduction: Psoriasis is a chronic debilitating auto immune
disease which manifests on the skin through red scaly plaques.
Biologic treatment have been very successful in controlling moderate
to severe psoriasis, however they are quite expensive and not
all treatments work for all patients. This study looks to understand
the demographics, treatment patterns, treatment failures, number
of therapies and time to switching. A cohort of 459 patients treated
with biologics was examined
Objectives: 1. To understand the demographics, treatment patterns,
treatment failures, number of therapies and time to switching.
2. To decipher patterns in biologic use in order to prescribe more
efficiently and optimize health care resources.
Methods: This was a retrospective cohort of all patients exposed
to biologic or PD-4 inhibitors within a single Dermatologist’s
private practice. A simple summary of patient demographics
including gender, treatment patterns, reasons and length of time
before discontinuation was compiled. Reasons for discontinuation
included lack of efficacy (primary or secondary), adverse events
(AEs), patient choice or other.
Results: There were 189 females (41.2%) and 270 males (58.8%)
with 914 incidences of biologic or PD-4 inhibitor treatment. The
mean age was 53.48±12.6 and the mean treatment duration was
37.3 months±39.5 (approx. 3000 treatment years).
39.2% of patients (180) remained on the first biologic (range 0.5
to 15 years). The mean number of therapies was 1.99 (range 1–8),
but increased to 2.63 if patients were not biologic naive.
More male patients stayed on their first biologic (74.2% in
ustekinumab-treated patients and in the Apremilast group 32.3%).
Reasons for discontinuation: AEs (14.69%) and non-response
(30%); highest rates were in etanercept (78.0%), and infliximab
(75.4%); lowest rates was in etanercept 12.8% (14 of 109 patients),
highest in infliximab 34.9%, (44 of 126 patients.
Conclusions: The most common cause for discontinuation of
biologics was an AE and non-responsiveness (45.69%). Women

were more likely to discontinue therapy than men. Males were
more likely to remain on the first biologic therapy. Adalimumab
and ustekinumab had lowest rates of discontinuation. Etanercept,
infliximab and apremilast had the highest.

Introduction: Risk of infections is a concern with cytokine inhibitor
treatments.
Objectives: This analysis assessed infections during phase 2 and
3 trials of tildrakizumab (TIL), a high-affinity, humanized, IgG1κ
monoclonal antibody against IL-23p19 under development for
moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.
Methods: Patients (Pts) were randomized in P05495 (phase 2;
NCT01225731), reSURFACE 1 (phase 3; NCT01722331), and
reSURFACE 2 (phase 3; NCT01729754) [1,2]. In Part 1 (Week
([W]1–16) of P05495, pts received subcutaneous (SC) TIL 5,
25, 100, or 200 mg or placebo (PBO) at W0 and W4 and were
rerandomized to various TIL doses in Part 2 (W16–52). In Part 1
(W1–12) of reSURFACE 1 and 2, pts received SC TIL 200 mg, TIL
100 mg, or PBO at W0 and W4. Pts were rerandomized in Part 2
(W12–28) and Part 3 (W28–64 or W28–52 in reSURFACE 1 and
2, respectively). Etanercept (ETN) 50 mg was an active control in
Parts 1–2 of reSURFACE 2. Treatment-emergent adverse event
data pools (n = 2081) for the PBO-controlled and full trial periods
(52 weeks for P05495/reSURFACE 2; 64 weeks for reSURFACE
1) were analyzed. Severe infections met the regulatory definition
of a serious adverse event or required intravenous antibiotics.
Results: In the PBO-controlled period, incidences of infections
were comparable for TIL 100 mg and 200 mg (23% and 22%,
respectively) and PBO (23%); all were comparable with ETN
(24%). Incidences of severe infections were low for all treatment
groups (range, 0.0%-0.3%; TIL P≥0.6 vs PBO). In the full trial period,
exposure-adjusted rates (pts/100 pt-years) for infections with
TIL 100 mg and 200 mg (48.9 and 52.6, respectively) were lower
than with PBO and ETN (79.5 and 86.0, respectively). Exposureadjusted
rates for severe infections were 1.10, 1.61, 1.96, and 0.91
for TIL 100 mg, TIL 200 mg, ETN, and PBO, respectively. In all,
33 severe infections were identified (respiratory: TIL 100 mg, 4
events; TIL 200 mg, 2 events; ETN and PBO, 0 events; skin: TIL
100 mg, 3 events; TIL 200 mg, 6 events; ETN, 2 events; PBO,
3 events; gastrointestinal: TIL 100 mg, 4 events; TIL 200 mg, 5
events; ETN and PBO, 0 events; urinary tract: TIL 200 mg, 1 event;
ETN, 1 event; TIL 100 mg and PBO, 0 events). One pt had bone
tuberculosis (TIL 200 mg; original purified protein derivative test
was negative); 1 sepsis event (TIL 200 mg) occurred months after
ending TIL treatment.
Conclusion: Infection rates with TIL treatment were low and
comparable to PBO and ETN during the PBO-controlled period.
By W52/64, exposure-adjusted rates remained low for all groups.

Introduction: Interleukin-23 is a key cytokine in the development
and maintenance of psoriatic lesions. Risankizumab is a humanized
IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to IL-23’s p19 subunit,
selectively inhibiting this critical cytokine and its role in psoriatic
inflammation.
Methods: UltIMMa-1 (n = 506) and UltIMMa-2 (n = 491) were
replicate, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-
controlled studies that evaluated efficacy and safety of risankizumab
in adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.
Patients were stratified by weight and prior TNFi-exposure and
randomized 3:1:1 to receive 150 mg risankizumab, 45/90 mg ustekinumab
(weight-based per label) or matching placebo. Patients
were dosed at weeks 0, 4, 16, 28, and 40, with placebo crossover
to risankizumab at week 16. Co-primary endpoints were PASI 90
and sPGA0/1 at week 16 versus placebo with comparisons between
risankizumab and ustekinumab as ranked secondary endpoints.
Missing data were imputed as non-response.
Results: All primary and ranked secondary endpoints were met
for both trials (p < 0.001). At week 16 of UltIMMa-1&2 trials,
risankizumab-treated patients achieved significantly higher PASI
90 (75.3%/74.8%) and sPGA0/1 (87.8%/83.7%) response rates
versus placebo- (4.9%/2.0%; 7.8%/5.1%) or ustekinumab-treated
Poster abstracts 29
Acta Derm Venereol 2018
patients (42.0%/47.5%; 63.0%/61.6%). At week 52, risankizumabtreated
patients achieved significantly higher response rates versus
ustekinumab. In both trials, treatment-emergent adverse event
(TEAE) rates were comparable across treatment groups throughout
the study duration. The most frequently reported TEAE was upper
respiratory tract infection.
Conclusion: Risankizumab was consistently superior to both placebo
and ustekinumab in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque
psoriasis. TEAE profiles were similar between risankizumab
and ustekinumab, and there were no unexpected safety findings.

Objective:To evaluate the efficacy and safety of guselkumab
(GUS) administered using a novel, self-injection device in adult
patients with moderate-severe plaque psoriasis (PsO).
Methods: ORION is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, doubleblind,
PBO-controlled study evaluating GUS administered using
a self-SC injection device that delivers the contents of a pre-filled
syringe. Patients of age≥18 years with moderate-severe PsO for
at least 6 months, IGA score ≥3, PASI score ≥12, and BSA ≥10%,
and were candidates for/or may have previously received systemic
therapy or phototherapy, were eligible for the study. At baseline,
78 patients were randomized to PBO (n = 16) at wks 0, 4, and
12 with crossover to GUS 100mg at wks 16, 20, and28 or GUS
(n = 62) at wks 0, 4, 12, 20, and 28. The co-primary endpoints were
the proportions of patients achieving 1) an IGA score of cleared
(0) or minimal (1) and 2) a PASI 90 response at wk16 (GUS vs
PBO). Major secondary endpoints were the proportions of patients
achieving an IGA score of 0 and a PASI 100 response at wk16.
Results through wk16 are presented.
Results: Baseline demographics and PsO disease characteristics
were generally similar between the PBO and GUS-treatment
groups. At wk16, significantly higher proportions of GUS vs PBO
patients achieved an IGA score of 0/1 (80.6% vs. 0.0%, p < 0.001)
and a PASI 90 response (75.8% vs. 0.0%, p < 0.001). In addition,
significantly higher proportions of GUS vs PBO patients achieved
an IGA score of 0 (56.5% vs 0.0, p < 0.001) and a PASI 100
response (50.0% vs 0.0, p < 0.001) at wk16.
Through wk16, the proportions of patients with ≥1 AE were
comparable between the treatment groups (GUS: 62.9%, PBO:
68.8%; respectively). Discontinuation rates due to AEs were 1.6%
for GUS patients and 6.3% for PBO patients. Two patients in the
GUS group had SAEs (1 chest discomfort and 1 atypical chest
pain). There were no serious infections, malignancies, or deaths.
Conclusion: GUS administered using a novel self-injection device
was efficacious and well-tolerated in patients with moderate-severe
PsO. The efficacy and safety profile of GUS administered with
this device was consistent with previously reported findings from
the pivotal phase 3 studies in which GUS was administered using
a different self-injection device.

Introduction: Etanercept (ETN) is an anti-tumor necrosis factor
medication that was among the first biologics approved for
psoriasis. Additional medications have been developed or are in
development for psoriasis, and patients who do not adequately
respond to ETN may benefit from these more recent biologics.
Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of tildrakizumab (TIL), a
high-affinity, humanized, anti-interleukin-23p19 antibody in
patients (pts) with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis
who were partial responders (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index
[PASI] ≥50– < 75) or nonresponders (PASI < 50) to ETN and were
subsequently rerandomized to TIL in a phase 3 trial.
Methods: Pts with psoriasis (≥10% body surface area, Physician’s
Global Assessment [PGA] ≥3, and PASI score ≥12) participated
in a 3-part, 52-week, randomized controlled trial (reSURFACE
2; NCT01729754) [1]. In Part 1 (Week [W]0–W12), pts were
randomized to subcutaneous TIL 200 mg, TIL 100 mg, or placebo
(PBO) administered at W0 and W4, or ETN 50 mg administered
2x/week. In Part 2 (W12–W28), TIL- and ETN-treated pts remained
on the same treatment (TIL administered at W16; ETN 1x/
week), whereas PBO-treated pts were rerandomized to TIL 100
or 200 mg. In Part 3 (W28–W52), ETN responders (PASI ≥75)
were discontinued, partial and nonresponders were switched to
TIL 200 mg (administered at W32, W36, W48). For this post hoc
analysis, the percentages of pts (±SD) with PASI responses and
PGA response (score of 0 [clear] or 1 [minimal] with at least a
2-grade score reduction from baseline) were determined at W52.
Primary results from the trial have been previously reported.
Results: In all, 1090 pts were randomized. Of the 313 pts randomized
to ETN, by W28 there were 83 partial responders and 39
nonresponders. At W52 (after 20 weeks of TIL treatment) for ETN
partial responders, 75%±5%, 34%±5%, 15%±4%, and 58%±5%
had achieved PASI 75, 90, 100, and PGA responses, respectively,
with TIL 200-mg treatment. At W52 for ETN nonresponders,
54%±6%, 31%±5%, 10%±3%, and 56%±5% had achieved PASI
75, 90, 100, and PGA responses, respectively, with TIL 200-mg
treatment. Adverse events were similar in pts switched from ETN
to TIL at W28, compared with the pts who were maintained on
TIL through W52.
Conclusions: A substantial portion of patients with moderate to
severe chronic plaque psoriasis who were partial responders or
nonresponders to ETN may respond after switching to treatment
with TIL 200 mg. TIL may be a reasonable option for those who
do not achieve adequate response to ETN.

Introduction: Tildrakizumab (TIL) is a high-affinity, anti–interleukin-
23p19 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of chronic
plaque psoriasis.
Objectives: We assessed a subgroup of patients with chronic plaque
psoriasis who reported prior treatment with apremilast (APT), a
phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, to evaluate its potential influence
on efficacy in 2 large phase 3 clinical studies of tildrakizumab.
Methods: The reSURFACE studies were 3-part, double-blind,
randomized controlled studies in patients (≥18 years of age) with
moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis [1]. TIL 100 and 200
mg were evaluated for 64 weeks (reSURFACE 1; NCT01722331)
and 52 weeks (reSURFACE 2; NCT01729754). Part 1 (0–12
weeks) was placebo (PBO)-controlled, whereas Part 2 (12–28
weeks) rerandomized PBO patients to TIL. The washout period
for discontinuation of APT before randomization in these studies
was 4 weeks. In this post hoc analysis, we analyzed the efficacy
responses to TIL in patients who reported prior exposure to APT.
Physicians’ Global Assessment (PGA) (0 or 1) and Psoriasis Area
and Severity Index (PASI) 75, 90, and 100 responses were assessed
at Weeks 12 and 28 in this cohort. One patient with missing data
at Weeks 12 and 28 was considered to be a nonresponder at these
visits. The TIL groups were pooled owing to the small numbers
reporting prior APT exposure.
Results: The pooled reSURFACE 1 and 2 dataset includes 1238
patients randomized to TIL; of these, prior APT exposure was
reported by 35 patients (n = 21 for 100 mg and n = 14 for 200 mg).
In the overall pooled population of TIL-treated patients, PASI 75,
PASI 90, PASI 100, and PGA (0.1) responses were achieved by
783 (63%), 450 (36%), 161 (13%), and 715 (58%) at Week 12
and 898 (73%), 647 (52%), 303 (25%), and 784 (63%) at Week
28, respectively. In the population of TIL-treated patients with
prior APT exposure, PASI 75, PASI 90, PASI 100, and PGA (0.1)
responses were achieved by 21 (60%), 9 (26%), 5 (14%), and 22
(63%) at Week 12 and 27 (77%), 16 (46%), 7 (20%), and 22 (63%)
at Week 28, respectively. There were no discontinuations due to
adverse events (AEs) among patients with prior APT exposure.
Conclusions: Efficacy responses with TIL were similar for the
small sample of patients with prior exposure to APT and the overall
pooled population from reSURFACE 1 and reSURFACE 2. These
results were consistent with the notion that no adverse effect on efficacy
or discontinuations due to AEs are expected when initiating
treatment with TIL among patients with prior exposure to APT.

Introduction: Interleukin-23 (IL-23), a key regulator of multiple
effector cytokines (including IL-17, IL-22, and TNF), is thought
to drive the development and maintenance of psoriatic lesions.
Risankizumab is a potent humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody
that inhibits IL-23 by specifically binding its p19 subunit.
Objectives: To report efficacy and safety results of risankizumab
from initial 16-week (wk) placebo (PBO)-controlled period of
IMMhance trial in patients (pts) with moderate-to-severe chronic
plaque psoriasis (PsO).
Methods: IMMhance (NCT02672852) is a phase 3 multicenter,
randomized, double-blind, PBO-controlled trial, evaluating the
efficacy and safety of risankizumab versus PBO in pts with
moderate-to-severe chronic plaque PsO. The initial 16-wk PBOcontrolled
period (507 pts, stratified by weight and prior TNFiexposure,
randomized 4:1 to receive either risankizumab [150 mg
at wks 0 and 4] or PBO) was followed by randomized withdrawal
and subsequent re-treatment with risankizumab. Co-primary endpoints
were PASI 90 and sPGA 0/1 responses at wk 16; missing
data were imputed as non-responders.
Results: At baseline, the mean age and weight were 49.2 years
and 92.0 kg, respectively; 70.2% of pts were male. A history of
diagnosed or suspected psoriatic arthritis was reported in 34.7%
of pts and prior TNFi therapy was reported in 36.5% of pts. Mean
baseline PASI and BSA were 20.2 and 26.1%, respectively. At
wk 16, all primary and ranked secondary endpoints were met
(p < 0.001). At Wk 16, risankizumab -treated pts achieved significantly
higher PASI 90 (73.2%) and sPGA 0/1 (83.5%) response
rates versus PBO-treated pts (2.0%; 7.0%). Treatment-emergent
adverse events (TEAEs) and serious AEs were reported in 45.5%
and 2.0% of risankizumab-treated pts, respectively. Through 16
wks, there were no deaths, major adverse cardiovascular events,
or cases of tuberculosis in risankizumab-treated pts.
Conclusions: Risankizumab was superior to PBO in the treatment
of adult pts with moderate-to-severe plaque PsO. The safety profile
was consistent with previously reported risankizumab trials with
no new or unexpected safety findings.

Introduction: Tildrakizumab (TIL) is a high-affinity anti–IL-23p19
antibody that showed efficacy in 2 phase 3 chronic plaque psoriasis
studies (reSURFACE 1 [NCT01722331] and 2 [NCT01729754])
[1]. Some dichotomous efficacy measures, eg, proportions of patients
achieving a 75% Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)
response, provide limited efficacy and disease severity information
at a patient level. Analysis of patient-level PASI data could
address these limitations.
Objective:To identify potential insights into efficacy assessment

and disease severity using a post hoc analysis of patient-level
PASI data.
Methods: ReSURFACE 1 and 2 methods have been described previously
[1]. Patients who participated in either TIL phase 3 study
received TIL 100 mg or TIL 200 mg at Week (W)0 and W4, and
every 12 weeks thereafter, or placebo (PBO) at W0 and W4 then
TIL 100 mg or 200 mg at W12 and W16. PASI score distributions
were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
Results: Numbers of patients and mean and median PASI scores
are shown in the Table. By W4 (1 dose), 55% of patients in both
TIL arms had PASI < 12, and would no longer meet clinical trial
entry criteria. The percentage of patients with PASI < 12 increased
during TIL treatment: 87% at W12, 93% at W28 (100 mg); 90%
at W12, 97% at W28 (200 mg). At W12, 32% (TIL 100 mg),
29% (TIL 200 mg), and 2% (PBO) of patients had PASI ≤ 1.0.
By W28, 48% (TIL 100 mg) and 52% (TIL 200 mg) of patients
had PASI ≤ 1.0. Median PASI scores at W28 were 2.0 (TIL 100
mg) and 1.0 (TIL 200 mg).
Conclusions: These results suggest that PASI scores may provide
additional information about disease severity, and resolution with
treatment, that might not otherwise be available using dichotomous
PASI assessments. Most TIL-treated patients had clinical
improvement by W4, and ≈50% had nominal disease severity
(PASI ≤ 1.0) by W28.

Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA
Introduction: Two phase-3, double-blind, randomized controlled
trials (reSURFACE 1: NCT01722331; reSURFACE 2:
NCT01729754) have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of tildrakizumab,
a high affinity, humanized, IgG1 κ, anti-interleukin–23
monoclonal antibody, in the treatment of adult patients with
moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis over 28 weeks1.
Objective:This analysis evaluated whether the efficacy is sustained
or improved from week 28 through week 52.
Methods: Both trials randomized adult patients with moderate-tosevere
plaque psoriasis to receive tildrakizumab 100 mg or 200
mg at weeks 0, 4, then every 12 weeks. At week 28, patients with
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) response ≥50% were
re-randomized, based on their week-28 PASI response, to receive
the same, a higher or a lower dose of tildrakizumab or placebo
(randomized withdrawal in reSURFACE 1 per the trial designs).
The current analysis evaluated only patients treated with the same
dose of tildrakizumab (100 mg or 200 mg) throughout the first
52 weeks. Four mutually exclusive groups were created based
on week-28 PASI response: PASI 100, PASI 90–99, PASI 75–89
and PASI 50–74. PASI responses at week 52 (observed data) were
analyzed for each week-28 PASI-response group.
Results: This analysis included 352 patients on tildrakizumab 100
mg (male: 69.9%; mean baseline age: 44.9 years) and 313 on tildrakizumab
200 mg (male: 67.1%; mean baseline age: 46.4 years).
The proportions of patients achieving PASI 100, PASI 90–99, PASI
75–89 and PASI 50–74 at week 28 were 25.9%, 38.4%, 25.3%
and 10.5% respectively for those on the 100 mg dose, and 24.6%,
24.3%, 19.5% and 31.6% respectively for those on the 200 mg
dose. Among patients who achieved week-28 PASI≥90 with either
dose of tildrakizumab, 88.9–89.4% maintained PASI≥90 at week
52. Overall, 91.1% patients on the 100 mg dose and 93.9% on the
200 mg dose with week-28 PASI≥75 maintained PASI≥75 at week
52. In addition, 39.3–40.4% of patients with week-28 PASI 75–89
remained PASI 75–89 at week 52 and 33.7%-41.0% improved to
PASI≥90. Among patients with week-28 PASI 50–74, 20.2–29.7%
achieved PASI≥90 and 52.5–64.9% achieved PASI≥75 at week
52. Overall, only 2.6% of patients on the 100 mg (9 out of 352)
or 200 mg (8 out of 313) dose had week-52 PASI < 50.
Conclusions: Among patients with moderate-to-severe plaque
psoriasis treated with tildrakizumab 100 or 200 mg at weeks 0,
4, then every 12 weeks, those who achieved week-28 PASI≥50
and continued on the same dose had sustained or improved efficacy
from week 28 through week 52. The majority patients who
achieved week-28 PASI≥75 or PASI≥90 maintained PASI≥75 or
PASI≥90 at week 52. More than half of partial responders (PASI
50–74) at week 28 eventually achieved PASI≥75 and at least 1 in
5 achieved PASI≥90 at week 52.

cy and safety in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis
in two phase 3, double-blinded, randomized controlled trials (re-
SURFACE 1: NCT01722331; reSURFACE 2: NCT01729754)1.
Objective:The analysis examined the association between qualityof-
life improvements and the degree of skin clearance in patients
enrolled in the two phase 3 trials and treated with tildrakizumab
100 mg or 200 mg at weeks 0, 4, then every 12 weeks.
Methods: Both trials used a three-part design: Part 1 (weeks 0–12)
was placebo-controlled; Part 2 (weeks 12–28) re-randomized
placebo patients to receive tildrakizumab 100 or 200 mg; Part 3
(weeks 28–64, reSURFACE 1; weeks 28–52, reSURFACE 2) rerandomized
patients from the tildrakizumab arms with Psoriasis
Area and Severity Index (PASI) response ≥50 at week 28 to receive
the same, a higher, or a lower dose of tildrakizumab, or placebo
(randomized withdrawal in reSURFACE 1). The Dermatology Life
Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire was administered at weeks
0, 12, 28, 40, and 52. Tildrakizumab-treated patients were pooled
from the two trials and classified into 5 mutually exclusive groups
based on their week-28 PASI response: PASI < 50, PASI 50–74,
PASI 75–89, PASI 90–99, and PASI 100. Baseline characteristics,
the proportion of patients with DLQI 0/1, and mean DLQI changes
from baseline were examined for each PASI response group.
Results: Overall, 575 patients on tildrakizumab 100 mg (male:
69.6%; mean baseline age: 45.6 years) and 581 on tildrakizumab
200 mg (male: 73.0%; mean baseline age: 45.9 years) were included.
At week 28, 8.3%, 22.0%, 40.9%, 66.3%, and 86.5% (8.7%,
35.2%, 43.9%, 70.4%, and 85.9%) of patients with PASI < 50,
50–74, 75–89, 90–99, and 100 achieved DLQI 0/1 for those on
100 mg (200 mg), respectively. Patients with higher week-28 PASI
response also had greater mean DLQI reductions from baseline
at week 28 (100 mg: 5.7-13.4; 200 mg: 5.4–12.9). Similar patterns
were observed among patients continuously treated with
tildrakizumab 100 mg or 200 mg from baseline to week 52, with
better PASI-response patients having greater proportions achieving
DLQI 0/1 and greater DLQI reductions sustained from week 28
through week 52.
Conclusion: Tildrakizumab-treated patients with higher levels of
PASI response also demonstrated better quality-of-life improvements.
Achieving PASI 100 was not necessarily associated with
achieving DLQI 0/1, therefore both efficacy and quality-of-life
improvements need to be evaluated separately to provide a complete
picture of treatment success.

STATISTIC REVIEW OF PSORIASIS SYSTEMATIC
THERAPIES IN NORTH GREECE
Konstantinos Efthimiadis, Florentina-Silvia Delli
State Clinical for Skin and Venereal Diseases Thessaloniki, Greece
Introduction: Psoriasis is a chronic disease that can have a
significant effect on quality of life. Therefore, management of
psoriasis involves both psychosocial and physical aspects of
this disease, lately generally admitted as systemic. Numerous
topical and systemic therapies are available for the treatment of
the cutaneous manifestations of psoriasis. In our daily clinical
practice, treatment modalities are chosen on the basis of disease
severity estimated with PASI and DLQI, relevant comorbidities,
and patient preference.
Objective:To assess the frequencies of each systemic drug, classical
or biological, used for the treatment of mild, moderate to
severe psoriasis in our hospital care unit from January 2016 since
December 2016.
Methods: Moderate to severe psoriasis was defined by PASI > 10
and/or DLQI > 10 and/or any PASI in a patient with psoriatic
arthritis.
Results: Most of our patients with mild to moderate psoriasis are
using topical and classical therapies. A significant number of patients
with severe psoriasis are using biological therapies and about
a half of them were already used a classical or other biologic drug.
Conclusion: Despite the fact that new biological drugs are available
for psoriasis treatment, it seems that the patients with mild
psoriasis are still treating with topical products. At least as far as it
concerns our Mediterranean country, it seems that our patients difficult
accept the biological therapies as first choice line treatment.

Introduction & Objectives: The spectrum of antipsoriatic systemic
therapies is constantly changing. The short-term efficacy and
safety of the various therapies are demonstrated in controlled
clinical studies. The German Psoriasis Registry PsoBest aims to
gain long-term evidence of safety and effectiveness in routine
care. Updated interim data of long-term safety of biological and
non-biological treatment of psoriasis is presented.
Materials & Methods: The non-interventional German Psoriasis
Registry PsoBest observes adult patients with moderate to severe
psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis. Patients are registered at naïve
systemic treatment start and are observed for 10 years in routine
care. The registry aims to gain long-term evidence of safety and
effectiveness of systemic antipsoriatic drugs. Data is collected
in dermatological practices and walk-in clinics. Presented are
standardised patient rates per 100 patient years (py) of exposure
classified by system organ classes of MedDRA® (SOC, Medical
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities).
Results: Until June 2017, 5,825 patients were registered and
sufficient for analyses. They were predominantly male (58.8%),
had a mean age of 47.7 years (SD 14.5) and 30.0% of patients
suffered psoriatic arthritis. 4,729 patient years (py) were observed
on biologic treatments and 6,583 py on other systemic treatments.
For all cause death, malignancies and other serious adverse events
(SAE), there were no significant differences between the treatment
cohorts. Highest SAE rates were observed in the SOCs Surgical
and medical procedures (3.5 and 2.6 patients/ 100 py on biologics
and non-biologics, respectively), General disorders and administration
site conditions (2.0 and 1.8 patients/ 100 py), Infections
and infestations (1.6 and 1.1 patients/ 100 py) and Neoplasms (1.4
and 1.3 patients/ 100 py). Events from other SOCs were observed
for less than 1 patient/ 100 py.
Non-serious adverse events (AE) within the SOCs Skin and subcutaneous
tissue disorders, Renal and urinary disorders, Blood
and lymphatic system disorders, Gastrointestinal disorders,
Nervous system disorders, Vascular disorders as well as Investigations
were less frequent in biologic treatment compared to
non-biologics (2.2 vs. 5.3, 0.3 vs. 0.7, 0.4 vs. 2.3, 2.4 vs. 11.3, 1.3
vs. 2.7, 1.2 vs. 2.1 and 2.0 vs. 3.4 patients/ 100 py, respectively,
p ≤ 0.05). Non-serious infections were observed more often in
biologics (7.0 vs. 4.8 0 patients/ 100 py, p ≤ 0.05). For the lately
authorized treatments secukinumab and apremilast 253 and 111
py were observed, for biosimilar treatment 5 py. They showed no
deviations from the previously observed safety profile of other
systemic therapies.
Conclusions: In the general, no increased risk of biological or
non-biological treatments was observed. The specific differences
in non-serious events will be evaluated in more detail in future

analyses. For robust data on recently authorised therapeutics, more
observation time is needed, especially with a constantly changing
spectrum of treatments.

THE IMPACT OF PATIENT REQUESTS ON PSORIATIC
ARTHRITIS TREATMENT
Lynn Price, Jennifer Robinson, Gianna Melendez
Spherix Global Insights
Introduction: As a result of direct to consumer advertising, patients
frequently request well-known brands for the treatment of
psoriatic arthritis, and these patients tend to be highly involved
in their therapy decisions. Patient requests commonly relate to
formulation preferences, and in an indication dominated by biologics
administered either subcutaneously or intravenously, oral
small molecules are in high demand.
Objectives: One of the objectives of this study was to gain further
insight into patient requests as a main driver for switching to and
from biologics/apremilast.
Methods: An independent market analytics firm collaborated
with US rheumatologists (n = 200) to conduct a retrospective
chart review of patients diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis (PsA)
(n = 1,008), who had switched from one biologic therapy or
apremilast to another in the prior twelve weeks. Rheumatologists
were able to submit up to seven PsA patient charts. Data were collected
in April 2017 and included clinical and non-clinical patient
demographics, as well as physician demographics and attitudinal
survey responses.
Results: PsA patients tend to be very involved when it comes to
treatment decisions as 60 percent of patients had significant input
or were the primary driver behind the recent decision to switch
agents. Of those patient driven switches, only 36 percent of treating
rheumatologists felt there was strong clinical rationale behind the
switch; despite this, nearly half of rheumatologists state they tend
to approve specific patient requests.
Two-thirds of collaborating rheumatologists believe patients would
choose an oral agent over one that administered subcutaneously,
thus switching to apremilast is particularly common when patients
are involved in the decision. Patient requests were the primary
driver behind 24 percent of all switches to apremilast, compared
to just 12 percent when switching to a biologic. Furthermore, for
rheumatologists who are not in favor of an “apremilast before
biologics” treatment approach, patient requests are significantly
more of a driver for the brand than those who have adopted an
“apremilast before biologics” approach.
Conclusion: PsA patients are highly involved in the decision to
initiate and switch biologic/apremilast therapies, and treating rheumatologists
tend to be open to granting such requests, regardless
of clinical rationale. When patient requests are a primary driver
for switching, apremilast benefits the most; largely due to the oral
formulation. With the new approval of the first JAK inhibitor and
second oral option in the PsA market, tofacitinib will likely fill a
gap for both physicians and patients by introducing a high efficacy
oral option, warranting follow-up analysis on the evolution and
impact of patient requests in PsA.

THE RISK OF KC IN PSORIASIS PATIENTS RECEIVING
BIOLOGICS COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL
SYSTEMIC THERAPIES
Kayleigh Mason
The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK
Introduction: Whether psoriasis patients exposed to biologic
therapies have an elevated risk of keratinocyte carcinoma (KC),
including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or cutaneous squamous cell
carcinoma (cSCC) remains uncertain.
Objective:The aim of the present study was to determine whether
such patients were at higher risk of developing a KC compared to
those on conventional therapy.
Methods: The British Association of Dermatologists Biologic
Interventions Register (BADBIR), a pharmacovigilance register
of psoriasis patients, explores the long-term safety of systemic
therapies. Patients with chronic plaque psoriasis registering to
BADBIR on their first biologic or a conventional therapy, who had
at least one follow-up completed were included in analyses if they
were of white ethnicity, Fitzpatrick skin types 1–4 and reported
no previous cancers. Confounding factors included: age; sex;
smoking; and previous exposure to acitretin, psoralen ultraviolet-
A (PUVA), ciclosporin, and/or PUVA and ciclosporin. Propensity
score-weighted Cox-proportional hazard models estimated the
hazard ratio (HR) for developing a first KC or separately, first
BCC or cSCC.
Results: In total, 5672 patients initiating biologic therapy and 3188
patients on conventional therapy who met the entry criteria were
identified with 20558 and 7829 person-years of follow-up, respectively.
During follow-up, 74 (1.3%) patients initiating a biologic
therapy were diagnosed with their first KC (43 BCC; 34 cSCC
first) and 22 (0.7%) patients receiving conventional therapy with
their first KC (15 BCC; 10 cSCC first). No significant difference
in risk was observed for developing a KC (adjusted HR 1.05; 95%
CI 0.64, 1.73), BCC (0.84; 95% CI 0.45, 1.54) or cSCC (1.20;
95% CI 0.57, 2.50) on biologic compared to conventional therapy.
Conclusion: Biologic therapy does not appear to confer a higher
risk of developing a first KC as compared to conventional therapy
in psoriasis patients. These data will help inform clinical decision
making in psoriasis patients at risk of KC in whom biologic or
conventional therapy is being considered.

Introduction: Optimal clinical management of psoriasis (PsO) and
psoriatic arthritis (PsA) requires understanding of their impact
on patients.
Objectives: NORPAPP aimed to evaluate disease prevalence and
patient perceptions of severity in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway.
Methods: NORPAPP was an on-line survey carried out during
November and December 2015 using YouGov panels in Sweden,
Denmark, and Norway. The survey included 44 questions covering
self-perceived disease severity/symptoms, quality of life, contact
with the healthcare system, and treatment. The initial survey
population was randomly selected using framing quotas based
on population census data to ensure inclusion of a representative
sample of adults (aged 18–74 years) from each country. Participants
were asked if they had PsO or PsA and if it was physician
diagnosed: those diagnosed by a physician were invited to participate
in the full survey. Final survey data were weighted to match
national sex and age distributions. Self-perceived disease severity
was expressed by a 5-level score. Severity of PsO based on the %
body surface area (BSA, mild ≤ 3%; moderate 4–9%; and severe
34
www.medicaljournals.se/acta
5th World Psoriasis & Psoriatic Arthritis Conference 2018
≥10%) was based on the respondent’s estimate of palms of affected
skin (1 palm = 1% BSA).
Results: Among 22,050 individuals questioned, reported prevalence
of PsO and/or PsA was 9.7% (9.4% in Sweden, 9.2% in Denmark,
and 11.9% in Norway); 1264 (5.7%) individuals reported
physician diagnosis and 1221 of these completed the full survey.
Among survey participants, 74.6% reported PsO alone, 10.3% PsA
alone, and 15.1% both. There was a limited correlation between
self-perceived disease severity and estimates of % BSA for PsO
(Spearman’s rho 0.42). Self-perceived PsO severity was related
to the most common symptoms (itching and flaking/scales) but %
BSA-based clinical severity was not. Respondents with PsA+PsO
reported significantly worse self-perceived severity and % BSA
of PsO than those with PsO alone. Overall, PsA symptoms were
self-perceived to be more severe than PsO symptoms.
Conclusion: Patient perceptions of PsO severity differ from their
estimates of %BSA and should be considered in the assessment
and management of PsO.

Introduction: Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated disease that
negatively affects the quality of life of patients.1 Despite recent
advancements in treatment, patient expectations may differ from
the treatment outcome, potentially leading to dissatisfaction.
Objective:To evaluate patient expectations on psoriasis treatment
outcomes and to what extent these were met by the treatment.
Methods: Data were collected from patients with moderate-tosevere
psoriasis with ≥ 3% skin involvement. Patients were included
from 17 European countries and Canada through a structured,
web-based interview in their local language. Patients were on
topical, PUVA/phototherapy, conventional systemic or biological
treatment. Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted.
Results: Overall, 1946 patients (mean [SD] age: 42 [13] years,
43% male) with psoriasis were surveyed between 6 July 2016 and
5 May 2017. The vast majority of patients currently on treatment
reported reduced itchiness (69%), reduced flaking (62%), and
clearer skin/skin that looked better generally (61%) as the main
expectations of their treatment. In addition, these patients reported
duration of effect (41%), extent of overall skin clearance (36%),
and speed of onset (34%) as the main influences for changing their
current treatment. Furthermore, patients were asked whether their
achieved results matched with their initial treatment expectations.
Patients reported that the convenience of dosing (68%) and administration
method (68%) completely met, or even exceeded their
initial expectations for the treatment. Conversely, expectations for
reduced itchiness (62%), reduced flaking (62%), clearer skin/ skin
that looked better generally (63%) were only partially met or not
met at all. Approximately, two-third of patients were dissatisfied
or only partially satisfied with the extent of their skin clearance
and improvement in at least one specific area. Specifically, scalp
(48%), legs (42%), and arms (41%) were the highest rated areas
if asked for insufficient satisfaction for clearance.
Conclusion: Data from this international survey indicate that
efficacy and maintenance of response are the patients’ primary
expectations of psoriasis treatment whereas, insufficient response
to therapy in difficult-to-treat areas appears to be a major reason
for patient dissatisfaction.

Introduction: Psoriatic comorbidities have been shown to be
inversely associated with socioeconomic position (SEP). We hypothesized
that the social patterning of paediatric psoriasis would
be similar to that observed for several psoriatic comorbidities, such
as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Objectives: Our aim was to investigate whether maternal SEP is
a determinant of paediatric psoriasis.
Methods: Data on paediatric psoriasis from 36,003 offspring of a
national birth cohort were cross-linked with nation-wide registry
data on maternal educational attainment, maternal labour market
attachment and equivalised household income. We performed logistic
regression analyses to test for associations between measures
of maternal SEP and paediatric psoriasis. Cohort analyses were
conducted, estimating the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence
intervals (CI) of offspring psoriasis. We included maternal age at
birth and maternal psoriasis as covariates in adjusted analyses.
Results: Maternal educational attainment and equivalised household
income were inversely associated with offspring psoriasis.
Offspring of mothers with a low educational attainment had an OR
1.62 (95% CI: 1.20–2.18; p < 0.01) of paediatric psoriasis, after
adjusting for maternal psoriasis and age, compared to offspring
of mothers with a medium educational attainment. Offspring of
mothers in the highest quartile compared to mothers in the lowest
quartile of equivalised maternal household income had an OR
0.59 (95% CI: 0.44–0.80; p < 0.001) of paediatric psoriasis, after
adjusting for maternal psoriasis and age.
Conclusion: Lifetime prevalence of paediatric psoriasis was inversely
associated with maternal SEP in our study population. Early
life exposure to modifiable risk factors associated with SEP may
play an important role in the development of paediatric psoriasis.
Future studies are warranted to clarify the role of mediating factors.

Introduction: Psoriasis is a T-helper-1 and -17 cell-mediated,
chronic, inflammatory skin disease affecting approximately 1–3%
of the general population. Psoriasis is currently considered as a
chronic low-grade inflammatory condition that plays an active
role in the development of the pathophysiologic phenomena
responsible for metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.
Obesity, as a component of the metabolic syndrome, represents a
major comorbidity and possibly contributes to reduced treatment
response.
Objective:This nationwide, population-based study investigated
the impact of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference
(WC) on the psoriasis in the Korean population.
Methods: We used the health check-up database, which is subPoster
abstracts 35
Acta Derm Venereol 2018
dataset of the Korean National Health Insurance Service database.
Study population includes subjects who had undergone health
screenings between January 2009 and December 2012. Patients
who were diagnosed with psoriasis prior to the health screening
or who were less than 20 years of age were excluded. This study
investigated newly diagnosed patients with psoriasis (ICD-10
code, L40) by dermatologists among subjects during the follow-up
period through the claim data.
Result: Total 22,633,536 subjects were included and psoriasis
newly developed in 399,461 subjects. Mean BMI among newly developed
psoriasis group (23.9±3.25) was higher than non-psoriasis
group (23.68±3.27)(p < 0.0001). Mean WC of newly developed
psoriasis group (81.21±9.27) was higher than non-psoriasis group
(79.99±9.26) (p < 0.0001). BMI showed J-shaped association with
the risk of psoriasis. Subjects with BMI over 30 had higher risk
of psoriasis (HR 1.118, 95% CI 1.1–1.137). The risk of psoriasis
increased in proportion to WC. Subjects with WC over 105 cm
showed highest risk of psoriasis (HR 1.305, 95% CI 1.261–1.349)
after adjusting confounding factors including BMI. The risk of
psoriasis increased most in the male group with normal weight,
abdominal obesity (HR 1.175, 95% CI 1.15–1.2).
Conclusion: According to our study, the WC is more likely to affect
the risk of psoriasis than obesity. Our study supports the association
between abdominal obesity and psoriasis, which increases
awareness of the role of abdominal obesity in the pathogenesis
and comorbidities of psoriasis.

CLINICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF PSORIATIC
ARTHRITIS IN A MULTIDISCIPLINARY CARE MODEL
OF PATIENTS WITH PSORIASIS
Dalila Alejandra Lopez-Rodriguez
Dermatologico Country
Introduction: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthropathy
that occurs in patients with Psoriasis (PsO). The frequency
of PsA in patients with PsO has been estimated between 10–40%.
The presentation and clinical course are variable, therefore, it is
necessary to understand the clinical behavior, severity and associated
factors that condition functional impairment, disability
and lost quality of life.
Objective:To describe the clinical features of the ApS, in a multidisciplinary
PsO clinic.
Methods: Prospective study, August 2016-february 2018, patients
attending to Multidisciplinary Clinic for psoriasis in Dermatologico
Country were included.
Results: A total of 53 participants were included, finding a prevalence
of psoriatic arthropathy of 58.5%.
The median age was 42 years and 71% were female. Patients with
ApS have higher frequency of DM2, metabolic syndrome and
hepatic steatosis. However, the differences are not statistically
significant, which could be a result of the sample size. According
to the activity of PsO the most frequent presentation was plaque
psoriasis in 67.7%. Median PASI was 5.4 (1.5, 16.4). Axial presentation
of ApS was observed in 51.6% and peripheral disease
in 71%, enthesitis was found in 54.8% and dactylitis 16.1%.
To determine the severity of PsA according DAS 28 score, we
found 45.2% of patients presented severe activity. One hundred
percent of the subjects with peripheral disease did not achieve
low activity criteria of the disease measured by MDA. When
calculating the tertiles of the HAQ instrument, it is possible to
observe that 51.6% of patients presented severe deterioration
in the quality of life. In the logistic regression model without
adjustment, the presence of a severe DAS 28 is associated with
an increase in the risk of deterioration in quality of life, with OR
of 6.24 (1.74, 22.2). The presence of BMI > 27 is associated with
an increase in the risk of deterioration in quality of life with OR
of 6.53 (1.59, 26.8). When performing the adjusted multivariate
model, the only variables that were associated with severe deterioration
of quality of life were the presence of BMI > 27 and
on the other side, pain, with BMI > 27 is the factor that mostly
impairs the quality of life.
Conclusions: Prevalence of PsA in this series of patients with skin
or nail psoriasis was 58.3%. The 45.2% of patients showed severe
activity and 51.6% severe deterioration in their quality of life, that
leads to disability and limitation performing daily activities. An
early diagnosis provides the possibility of appropriate treatment
to improve function, quality of life and decrease the progression
and complications of the disease.

Medical University, Sofia, Bulgaria; Dermatology clinic “Persenk”,
Sofia, Bulgaria
Introduction: Psoriasis is a chronic multisystem, inflammatory disease
that occurs at any age. It represents about 4% of all dermatosis
observed in children. Approximately one third of all patients
have onset of the disease under the age of 16. The most common
triggering factors in children are stress, Koebner phenomenon,
infections and seasonal change.
Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the most common
triggering and precipitating factors of psoriasis among Bulgarien
children.
Materials and Methods: This study included 42 consecutively
diagnosed children with psoriasis who presented in the Department
of Dermatology and Venereology at Alexandrovska University
Hospital, in Sofia, Bulgaria. The inclusion criteria were a clinical
diagnosis of psoriasis and age under 18 years.
Results: A total of 42 children with psoriasis were examined, 18
(42.85%) males and 24 (57.15%) females. The most frequent factors
precipitating psoriasis in our group of children were psychoemotional
stress in 16 (38.09%) cases. Koebner`s phenomenon
was observed in 3 (7.14%) patients. In only two (4.76%) children
triggering factors associated with psoriasis were infections. In 17
(40.47%) cases aggravating factors could not be identified. The
influence of the season on disease activity could be determined
in 25 (59.52%) patients. All of them showed worsening in winter
and improvement in summer.
Conclusion: The most frequent factors precipitating psoriasis in
children revealed in this study, were stressful life events, Koebner
phenomenon and infectious disease. Among patients who reported
triggering factors, stress was the most common cause. The study
showed that psoriasis in children relapses and worsens mainly in
winter season.

QUALITY OF CARE FOR PSORIASIS IN THE PAST 12
YEARS – RESULTS FROM A SERIES OF NATIONWIDE
HEALTH CARE STUDIES IN GERMANY
Matthias Augustin
Institute for Health Services Research in Dermatology
Introduction: In Germany, the quality of health care for psoriasis
was very critical in 2005. Most patients lacked of sufficient care
and there was only a minor proportion receiving systemic drugs.
In the mean time, there has been conducted a national psoriasis
program in order to improve the quality of psoriasis care, including
development of an evidence-based guideline, a consensus of
treatment goals, the invention of a “culture of measurement” and
consented national goals for psoriasis care. These measures were
supported by the establishment of 30 regional psoriasis networks
involving more than 800 dermatologists.
Objectives: (1) Presentation of the very recent results on the health
care situation of patients with psoriasis vulgaris in dermatological

5th World Psoriasis & Psoriatic Arthritis Conference 2018
treatment in Germany 2016/17 (2) Comparison of health care
quality indicators between the surveys 2004/05, 2007, 2013/14
and 2016/17.
Methods: Nationwide, non-interventional, cross-sectional studies.
In each survey between 71 and 130 centers included patients
and data from patients and dermatologists were obtained from a
minimum of 1500 patients per survey. Quality of care indicators
were severity of the psoriasis (PASI and proportion of patients
with PASI > 20, indicating high severity), quality of life (DLQI
and proportion of patients with DLQI > 10, indicating strong
impairments in quality of life), previous systemic therapy and
inpatient treatment in the last five years.
Results: Between January 2016 and December 2017 n = 1827
patients from 93 dermatological centers were included in the recent
survey (mean age 51 years, 45.2% female). 7.5% had severe
psoriasis (PASI > 20) compared to 9.2% in 2013/14, 11.6% in 2007
and 17.8% in 2004/05. The mean PASI was 7.3 compared to 8.1 in
2013/14, 10.1 in 2007 and 11.4 in 2005. The mean DLQI was 6.1
compared to 5.9 in 2013/14, 7.5 in 2007 and 8.6 in 2005. 21.4%
reported a strongly impaired quality of life (DLQI > 10) compared
to 21.3% in 2013/14, 28.2% in 2007 and 34.0% in 2005. 59.5% of
all participants stated that they had received systemic therapy at
least once within the last five years compared to 59.5% in 2013/14,
47.3% in 2007 and 32.9% in 2005. 18% received inpatient hospital
treatment within the last five years at least once, compared to
20.1% in 2013/14, 20.1% in 2007 and 26.9% in 2005.
Conclusions: It can be assumed that health care quality for psoriasis
patients in Germany has improved within the last 12 years.

GLOBAL PSORIASIS ATLAS – WORK STREAM 2
Matthias Augustin, Nirohshah Suthakharan
University Medical Center Hamburg, Institute for Health Services Research
in Dermatology and Nursing (IVDP)
Introduction: Psoriasis is a common, chronic and non-communicable
skin disease with an immensely negative impact on
people’s lives. There is a lack of standardized case-definition or
methodology leading to a wide variation in the prevalence estimate
between 0.09% and 11.43%. To tackle this knowledge deficit and
in response to the WHO Global report on Psoriasis (2016), the
Global Psoriasis Atlas (GPA) will be a first-ever online leading
epidemiological database on psoriasis. It will inform research,
policy and health care provision worldwide. GPA provides a
detailed disease prevalence and incidence as well as information
on access to treatment, comorbidities and cost to society which
will enable extensive comparisons between countries over time.
Furthermore, it will provide accurate health data for decision
makers, stakeholders and patients worldwide.
Objectives: The GPA includes two Work Streams (WS) Teams.
WS1 is conducting extensive literature review on psoriasis. In this
paper the WS2 is explaining the development of methodology
to serve the framework for compiling the GPA data. Methods:
Currently, data sources are being collected in two phases and
for the selection of data sources an in-/exclusion criteria were
developed and followed. Firstly, a global online survey on data
source identification is being conducted in > 150 countries worldwide
addressed to dermatologists and non-dermatologists. The
questionnaire identifies local, regional and national data sources
including registries, research institutes, projects, publications and
other relevant sources supporting the GPA project. Secondly, Desk
research on the same data sources is being conducted. Discussion
on the following aspects: identification of non-published sources,
integration of different sources, solving interpolation issues of
hard-to-reach areas and creating database.
Results: Desk research has identified potential data sources from
199 countries which includes 194 ministries of health, 97 registries,
84 patient associations, 32 statistic institutes, 25 Public Health
organizations, 230 research institutes (general/psoriasis specific),
13 claim data sources and 261 publications on psoriasis. The internal
pilot for the global online surveys has been completed by
an international expert team for further improvement. Currently,
the surveys are being sent out to dermatologists and non-dermatologists.
On a monthly base, both work streams are updating each
other about their achievements and issues.
Conclusion: In the next steps of Work Stream 2, a database will
be created in order to insert all identified data sources. Information
from identified data sources will be used to contact (via
email) the responsible persons to access this data. Additionally,
survey responses will be analyzed and added in the database.
This database will be updated regularly and extended to include
comorbidities in future.

GLOBAL BURDEN OF DISEASE: A SYSTEMATIC
LITERATURE REVIEW ON DISABILITY WEIGHTS FOR
SKIN DISEASES
Nirohshah Suthakharan, Matthias Augustin
University Medical Center Hamburg, Institute for Health Services Research
in Dermatology and Nursing (IVDP)
Introduction: Skin diseases account for one of the most common
human illnesses globally but in the recent Global Burden of Disease
(GBD) study, psoriasis, for example, ranked 144 out of 174
conditions in the DALY rankings. Two components of DALY calculation
are prevalence of the disease and disability weight factor.
The derivation of disability weight (DW) factor depends on many
factors which can lead to wide range of results. GBD methodology
can significantly underestimate the skin disease burden.
Objective:To understand the currently used DWs of skin diseases
in-depth and if these current records of DWs can be solely based
on a survey that was conducted on the general population.
Methodology: A systematic literature review was performed to
answer the research questions. Comprehensive search of eligible
scientific and grey publication in English, from 2007 to 2017, were
conducted in PubMed and EMBASE (Ovid). The studies included
were based on 16 skin condition and other diseases indicating a
re-estimation, alternative approach (also besides DALY) to DWs.
20 relevant studies were included and have been elaborated in the
review based on a ‘conceptual model of assessing DWs and its
design choices’ by Haagsma et al., 2014. The health state descriptions,
panel composition, and valuation methods used to derive
DWs in these studies is discussed in detail.
Results: There was scarce literature available for skin diseases
in particular. DW value depends on and can vary with the panel
composition: general public, health experts or patients. The health
state description whether disease specific or generic, with or
without label, describing the course of condition over a period or
only temporarily, can all influence the panel members’ decision.
The valuation methods paired comparison, population health
equivalence, visual analogue scale, standard gambling or person/
time trade-off can alter the results to a great extent. The contextual
differences across the countries can also make a difference in the
calculation. The inclusion of certain skin conditions/health states
under other medical specialties can be a major factor leading to
underestimation of overall skin disease burden worldwide.

Introduction: Polymorphism within the miR-499 has been reported
to be associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
in various populations.
Objectives: Our study aimed to find out whether similar association
could be observed also in Polish population in both RA and
psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients.
Methods: For this purpose 359 individuals were studied, including
111 RA patients, 86 patients with PsA and 162 healthy blood
donors that served as a control group. Genotyping for miR-499
rs3746444 T/C was performed using a LightSNiP assay.
Results: Distribution of the miRNA-499 alleles and genotypes
was similar in RA patients and controls. Among RA patients
those carrying the CC homozygous genotype presented with
lower DAS28 at diagnosis (0.027) but higher CRP levels after 12
weeks of anti-TNF treatment (p = 0.042). Interestingly, the TT
genotype (rs3746444) was overexpressed in patients with PsA
as compared to controls (OR = 1.85, p = 0.034) but its frequency
was not significantly different when compared to RA cases. This
polymorphism was also not found to be associated with clinical
parameters in PsA patients.
Conclusions: These results show that miR-499 rs3746444 T/C
polymorphism may constitute a risk factor for psoriatic arthritis
development.

ASSOCIATION BETWEEN INFLAMMASOME-RELATED
POLYMORPHISMS AND CLINICAL PHENOTYPES OF
PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS
Kristina Juneblad, Gerd-Marie Alenius
Department of Public Health and Clinical Mediciine, Rheumatology, University
Hospital, Umeå
Introduction: Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) disease expression can
vary from mild mono-/oligoarthritis to severe erosive polyarthritis
comparable with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), with or without axial
involvement, and manifestations such as dactylitis and enthesitis
are common. Markers of systemic inflammation (ESR or CRP) are
generally unhelpful as markers of disease severity since elevated
in only 50% of cases.
In recent years, research on the interleukin 1β (IL1 β)–regulating
protein complex, called the inflammasome, has shown interesting
associations with various inflammatory diseases. E.g. for RA (1)
and psoriasis (Pso) (2,3) associations with genetic polymorphisms
in genes related to the inflammasome has been discovered. So
far, no studies investigating genetic polymorphisms in inflammasome
genes in patients with Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) have
been published.
Aim: To analyse different single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNP:s) in genes related to the inflammasome in relation to different
disease phenotypes of Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA).
Methods: DNA from 771 PsA patients from Northern Sweden were
analyzed for different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
NLRP3 ( rs35829419 (NLRP3-Q750K), rs10733113, rs4353135),
CARD8 (CARD8-C10X, rs 2043211) and NLRP1 (rs8079034,
rs878329) in relation to different phenotypes of PsA.
Results: A significant association was seen with NLRP1 rs878329C
and patients with axial involvement of disease. When different
genotypes were compared, significantly higher frequency of genotype
CC were detected in the subgroup with axial involvement
of disease. In addition, NLRP1 rs8079034T was significantly
associated with prescription of a csDMARD. Also, the NLRP3
rs10733113 showed association with the G-allele in patients with
a skin disease with an early onset (Pso type1, onset < 40 years)
and in the subgroup of PsA with destructive-/deforming disease
significant association was found with the major allele, C, of
NLRP3 Q705K rs35829419. (Table 1)
Conclusions: In the study, we found association with different
phenotypes of PsA and different polymorphisms in inflammasome
genes. The results could indicate a possible role of inflammasomes
in different disease phenotypes of PsA and make further studies
in the area of interest.

Introduction: Studies describing the occurrence of inadequate
response (IR) to biologic treatments in psoriasis (PSO) in the realworld
setting are currently lacking. Thus an understanding of IR,
due to the lack of treatment durability, persistence, or access, to
1st line biologics in PSO may help to identify and address unmet
treatment needs.
Objectives: To assess the frequency of IR in the year after initiation
of 1st line biologic treatment for PSO. IR was defined as biologic
dose increase, biologic discontinuation, or add-on treatment.
Methods: Retrospective analysis of commercial US healthcare
claims (2012–2016) was conducted. Patients initiating a biologic
(PSO approved anti-TNF, secukinumab, ustekinumab, apremilast)
with ≥ 1 year of database enrolment before and after biologic
initiation (index date) who had a qualifying PSO ICD 9/10 code
and no previous biologic exposure in the year prior to the index
date were included. Patients experiencing any of the following
were classified as experiencing an IR event: 1) ≥ 1 claim with a
biologic dose > 110% of the label-recommended dose for ≥30
days, 2) cessation of 1st line biologic ( > 2 months with no treatment)
(‘non-switch discontinuation’), 3) cessation of first line
biologic followed by initiation of a new biologic within 2 months,
or 4) addition of a corticosteroid, immunosuppressant, or biologic
(‘add-on treatment’) with any days’ supply overlap.
Results: Of the 13,995 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 9,520
(68.0%) experienced an IR event in the 12-month follow-up period
(53.2% female; mean age: 46.2 yrs) and 4,475 (32.0%) did not
experience an IR event (45.2% female; mean age: 46.9 yrs). The
most frequently used 1st line biologics were adalimumab (42.5%)
and etanercept (26.5%); the proportion of IR patients was 60.4%
in adalimumab and 75.8% in etanercept. Among all IR patients,

5th World Psoriasis & Psoriatic Arthritis Conference 2018
non-switch discontinuation was experienced by 63.8% of patients,
switch to another biologic by 15.1%, above label dosing by 11.5%,
and add-on treatment by 9.7%. Overall, the mean time from initiation
of 1st line treatment to IR event was 4.7 months, ranging from
4.3 months to add-on therapy and 5.7 months for patients switching
to another biologic. Among patients switching to another biologic,
70.3% of patients were persistent on the new biologic after three
months versus 54.0% after 6 months. The most frequent add-on
therapies were immunosuppressive drugs (63.8%) followed by
systemic corticosteroids (20.6%), and biologics (15.5%).
Conclusions: IR in 1st line PSO biologic treatment is common
with non-switch discontinuation being the most frequent. This
highlights an opportunity to optimize treatment options currently
available and better understand patients’ needs for successful therapy.
Therapeutic options with improved durability may provide
a clinically meaningful path to optimizing psoriasis management.
Further analysis is necessary to identify underlying causes of IR
and to guide more effective approaches to treatment.

BARRIERS OF GUIDELINE-COMPLIANT CARE
FOR PSORIASIS IN GERMANY – RESULTS OF THE
EUROPEAN STUDY PSOBARRIER
Matthias Augustin, Anna Langenbruch, Marc Radtke, Nicole Zander
University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf
Introduction & Objectives: A series of nation-wide studies in
Germany over the last years has focused on the quality of psoriasis
care. It was found that a significant proportion of psoriasis patients
is not treated according to the national guideline1. Similar underprovision
of care has been identified in other countries as well,
reflected by patients’ dissatisfaction with the management of their
disease2. This study aims to identify these barriers of guidelinecompliant
healthcare for psoriasis in Europe.
Materials & Methods: The study assesses barriers and quality of
health care in a multi-centre, cross-sectional study design. Participating
centres in five European countries (Denmark, Poland,
Spain, United Kingdom, and Germany) aim to represent the range
of dermatological health care-providing outpatient facilities of the
respective country. The current analysis includes the data collected
in Germany from January 2016 to May 2017.
Results: Data of n = 497 patients were analysed. Mean age was 49.7
years, 41.4% were female. Mean PASI was 7.2 ± 9.2, 20.9% had a
PASI > 10. The mean DLQI was 6.2 ± 6.7. 27.0% were currently
treated with systemics (excluding biologics), 22.3% with biologics.
Since the diagnosis of psoriasis, the participants consulted
on average 3.0 ± 2.3 different dermatologists (min 0/max 27) and
had 3.5 ± 3.7 therapy changes. For 32.0% of the patients the time
between the first skin changes and the first diagnosis of psoriasis
was one year or longer. 7.6% stated that their health insurance
turned down a therapy, treatment or referral that was recommended
by a physician at least once.
Conclusions: The quite high numbers of consultations of different
dermatologists, therapy changes and therapies turned down indicate
that there might be barriers in psoriasis care. The generated
data facilitate measures for an improved patient access to systemic
drugs and biologics. The European comparison will allow for
the first time the direct description of psoriasis care in a wide
variety of European countries. The matching of patient-reported
outcomes with data of the health care system and barriers from
the physician’s perspective is a novelty worldwide and the results
will contribute to developing strategies to overcome these barriers.

INDIVIDUALISED THERAPY FOR PSORIASIS - CASE
SERIES
Seema Mahesh1, Viraj Shah2, Mahesh Mallappa1, George Vithoulkas3
1Centre For Classical Homeopathy, 2Shah Homeopathic Clinic, 3International
Academy of Classical Homeopathy
Introduction: Psoriasis and its complications are still a challenge
to clinicians. The autoimmune disorder though targeting the skin,
involves the immune system as a whole. The inflammatory component
in the pathogenesis of psoriasis has further established the
role of aberrant immune system in the process [1, 2, 3].
Homeopathy addresses every individual’s peculiar combination
of genetic and epigenetic causative factors in the development of
such auto immune diseases [4, 5]. Therefore it may be considered
as a therapy where integrated approach is indicated.
Case series: 5 cases of psoriasis are presented, two of which
were in erythrodermic state [one also with sepsis superimposed].
Through monitoring of blood markers and documenting on photos
and videos the effect of individualised homeopathic therapy on
psoriasis and its complications is demonstrated.
The theory of Levels of Health can explain the variety in the
presentation of psoriasis and response to treatment in terms of
the time taken and number of remedies required. The same theory
also helps to assess the prognosis and comprehend the response
to treatment [LOH]. With the help of the evidence of these cases
we may formulate a larger study to ascertain the extent to which
classical homeopathy may be employed in psoriasis.
Conclusions: These cases depict the potential for homeopathy in
alleviating the suffering of patients with psoriasis if applied as
individualised therapy and give grounds to further conduct controlled
studies to confirm the role of homeopathy in psoriatic therapy.

A UNIQUE CLINICAL CASE OF PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS
AND RELAPSING POLYCHONDRITIS
Elena Gubar, Alla Godzenko, Tatiana Korotaeva
Nasonova Research Institute of Rheumatology, Moscow
Introduction: Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is a rare systemic
autoimmune disorder affecting the cartilaginous structures of the
body and resulting in their destruction. In the literature available
we didn’t find any references to RP occurring together with psoriatic
arthritis (PsA).
Objective:to demonstrate a rare clinical case of RP and PsA.
Methods: Patient (pt) (female), 29 y.o., complained of pain, swelling,
and hyperemia of both ears, pain in the joints, in heels and
toes and pain in cervical spine. Scalp psoriasis (Ps) and Ps in the
external ear canal occurred in April, 2017, nail Ps and dactilitis in
October, 2017; in November, asymmetrical polyarthritis, pain in
heels, pain and limitation of movement in cervical spine developed.
Besides the pt noticed redness, swelling and pain in pinnas
of both ears and impairment of hearing; conjunctivitis, stomatitis
and subfebrile temperature developed.
Poster abstracts 39
Acta Derm Venereol 2018
At presentation: plaque Ps on the face and scalp, nail Ps, palmoplantar
feet pustulosis (BSA–4%, PASI –2.1); both pinnas of the
ears were swollen, painful and red; ear lobes were not involved.
The pt suffered from conjunctivitis. The pt had asymmetrical
polyarthritis, dactylitis, achillobursitis. Painful movements at
cervical spine, rotation 30°-35°. ESR 54 mm/h, CRP 99 mg/l,
RF negative, positive HLA B27, HLA B5 not detected. PET-CT
imaging did not reveal any pathological changes besides bilateral
auricular inflammation.
Results: PsA diagnosis was determined according to CASPAR
criteria. RP diagnosis was based on the McAdams criteria. The
diagnosis is definite when no less than three out of six criteria
are present: bilateral auricular chondritis, nonerosive seronegative
arthritis, nasal septum chondritis, ocular inflammation,
respiratory tract chondritis, and cochlear disorder. Our pt had
bilateral auricular chondritis, conjunctivitis, cochlear disorder.
The diagnosis was confirmed by ear-auricles biopsy which showed
perichondrial inflammation and granulocyte infiltration. The
therapy delivered: methotrexate s/c 10 mg pw; Solu-Medrol i/v
(750 mg cumulatively); methylprednisolone per os 16 mg per day.
Within days, there was normalization of temperature, ear-auricle
swelling, redness and pain had regressed; hearing was restored,
conjunctivitis passed, the intensity of arthritises, dactylitis and
spondylitis had decreased; the reduction in ESR, CRP was to 14
mm/h, to 7.0 mg/l accordingly.
Conclusion: As is known, when a pt has PsO, he is twice as
likely to develop additional autoimmune diseases. It is of great
importance to properly diagnose and treat cross autoimmune diseases.
Early diagnosis (within 3 months) and adequate treatment
resulted in rapidly decreased inflammatory process and in escaping
nonreversible changes in cartilage tissues.

SPINY FOLLICULAR HYPERKERATOSIS IN A PSORIASIS
PATIENT TREATED WITH USTEKINUMAB
Antoanela Carija, Adela Markota Cagalj, Neira Puizina Ivic
University Hospital Centre Split
Introduction: We present a psoriasis patient developing asymptomatic
white spiny follicular hyperkeratoses (SFH) after being
treated with ustekinumab for 3 months.
Objectives: This type of eruption has been described under several
names including spiny follicular keratoderma, hyperkeratotic spicules,
filiform hyperkeratoses, parakeratotic horns, and follicular
hyperkeratoses (1). Facial hyperkeratotic spicule eruption was reported
in association with monoclonal gammopathy. Drug-induced
filiform hyperkeratosis has been reported with cyclosporine, with
BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib), with acitretin and with vismodegib
and sorafenib.
Methods: Our patient started ustekinumab treatment in June
2015. At the same time he was treated with metothrexate, folic
acid, metformin and lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide. Three months
after ustekinumab introduction patient noticed growth of tiny skin
projections located on the face, scalp, upper trunk and upper arms.
Each spiny lesion was approximately 0.5 to 1 mm in diameter and
up to 5 mm high. A biopsy of a white spiny keratotic projection showed
orthokeratosis, achantosis and mild spongiosis in epidermis,
inflammatory infiltrate in chorium and dilatated acrotrichiums.
Condition resolved in several weeks without any treatment and
without ustekinumab cessation.
Results: A similar condition viral-associated trichodysplasia (TS)
was originally described in 1999 as a folliculocentric viral infection
in a patient who was receiving cyclosporine after kidney and
pancreas transplantation. Trichodysplasia spinulosa associated
polyomavirus (TSPyV) was identified in TS lesions and shown
to be the probable cause of this disease (2). Pathogenesis both of
viral-associated TS and BRAF inhibitor-induced SFH is based on
the paradoxical activation of MAPK (mitogen-activated protein
kinase) pathway, which regulates a variety of cellular processes
including cell division, differentiation and apoptosis.
Conclusions: Our patient developed SFH possibly due to use of
ustekinumab, IL-12 and IL-23 inhibitor. The latter has a role in
differentiation process of the skin (12), suggesting that inhibition of
IL-23 might explain the imperfect keratinization process observed
in SFH. Considering that in our patient drug was not stopped and
the condition resolved in several weeks without any treatment,
possible cause could be ustekinumab-induced immunosupression
and consequent viral infection.

COMBINATION THERAPY OF APREMILAST AND
BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT IN A PATIENT WITH
PSORIASIS
Koji Masuda, Fuminao Kanehisa, Norito Katoh
Department of dermatology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine
Apremilast was approved in March 2017 in Japan for the treatment
of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Apremilast appears to
have lower efficacy than biological product. However, its ease
of administration as an oral agent coupled with a mild side effect
profile makes it an attractive option for psoriasis treatment.
While monotherapy with biological products is effective for
many patients with psoriasis, some patients are not satisfied by
the outcome. There are few data or reports about the safety and
efficacy of apremilast in combination of biological product in the
treatment of psoriasis.
We report a 46-year-old man with about a twenty-year history of
plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis who failed several therapies
including topical therapy, phototherapy and etretinate. At the time
of presentation, the patient was using secukinumab for 9 months,
which had controlled his arthritis. However, the patient noted
plaque remained mainly on his lower legs. Apremilast was added
and up-titrated to 30 mg twice per day along with his secukinumab
therapy. After two months of combination therapy, the patient’s
disease has improved and stabilized with only a few scattered
erythematous mildly scaly plaques on his lower legs. The patient
denied side effects of nausea, diarrhea or headache. Laboratorywork
was within normal limits.
However, we also experienced two other cases who failed apremilast
add on therapy to biological product because of efficacy or
side effects. So, this method may be useful for uncontrolled patient
for psoriasis, more studies are needed to determine the safety and
efficacy of using these drugs together.

We won’t be insisting on the treatment nor the outcomes of these
patients whereas the aim of this presentation is to emphasize the
importance of patient’s education, prevention, but also of an early
and correct treatment.
Materials And Methods:
Case report no.1:
-Patient characteristics: 49-years-old white Caucasian male;
-Clinical presentation: widespread, confluent erythema of the skin,
large scales, malaise, intense joint pain, shivers, oliguria, marked
onychodystrophy of fingernails and toenails with an evolution of
about 1 week;

adenopathy;
-Patients history: Psoriasis vulgaris and Psoriatic arthritis since
2003 treated with 8 months Methotrexate switched (due to digestive
symptoms) to oral Acitretinum for about 2 months prior the
current presentation;
-Possible cause of the flare-up: lack of compliance to treatment,
but mostly because of disorderly lifestyle.
Case report no.2:
-Patient characteristics: 64-years-old white Caucasian male;

(discontinued after 2 years) and Methotrexate;
-Possible cause of the flare-up: voluntarily discontinuation of the
treatment (Methotrexate) 3 weeks prior to current presentation.
Case report no.3:
-Patient characteristics: 38-years-old white Caucasian female;
-Clinical presentation: pustular lesions spread throughout an
erythematous background intercalated with skin atrophies and
subepidermal pseudocysts disseminated throughout the body,
erythematous, scaly plaque on the scalp;
-Physical examination: vital signs within normal limits;
-Patients history: Pustular Psoriasis from the age of 7 treated with
Prednisone, Acitretinum and topical steroids;
-Possible cause of the flare-up: voluntarily discontinuation of
the treatment (Acitretinum) 7 months prior to current presentation
(the patient wishes to conceive) and long-term use of potent
topical steroids.
Results: All three cases were treated considering the Psoriasis
type, clinical presentation and symptoms, each of them having a
positive evolution during the hospitalization and follow-up visits.

SUCCESSFUL SWITCHING TO BIOSIMILAR IN
PSORIATIC PATIENT WITH SEVERE DRUG REACTION
TO INFLIXIMAB. A CASE REPORT

UOA, 2Department of Dermatology-venereology, 401 Military Hospital,
Greece
Introduction: Biosimilar medicines are drugs which are highly
similar to other biological medicines already licensed and that do
not have any clinically meaningful difference to the originator
drug in structure, pharmacokinetics, quality, safety or efficacy.
Objectives: Many clinical and observational studies involving a
switch between reference infliximab and its biosimilars have been
conducted or are ongoing. Switching between reference biologics
and biosimilars should be performed by the prescriber for clinical
reasons such as optimizing efficacy or minimizing AES. Efficacy
and clinical measures of safety were similar in the switched and
not switched groups at studies end. Differences in the type of AES
upon switching must also be considered. Because biosimilars are
structurally distinct from innovator biologic, they may produce
significantly different side effects. Although, data in the literature
suggest that if a patient experience a severe allergic reaction to
the originator drug it is most possible the same reaction to happen
with the biosimilar this may not always be the case.
Methods/Results: We present a case of a 60 years old female patient
with severe plaque psoriasis from 25 years treated with infliximab
every eight weeks for the last five years with great therapeutic efficacy.
During the last five infusions she presented mild reaction
with itching and facial redness which was treated successfully
with antihistamines without the need of interrupting the infusion.
Patient was also administered pretreatment therapy with a three day
course of corticosteroids to minimize these reactions. During the
last infusion patient presented severe body rash and hypotension
which led to the discontinuation of the infusion. Due to the great
therapeutic response and because patient had undergone several
therapies in the past which either hadn’t tolerated or hadn’t responded
to, she was reluctant to change therapy so we decided to
switch to a biosimilar. Patient is currently through the eight month
of treatment with the biosimilar with no sign of reaction and with
maintenance of the therapeutic response.
Conclusion: Biologics are much more complex than conventional
chemical drugs because they are larger and have more complicated
structures, so it is impossible to produce biosimilars that are identical
to the originator drug. As a result, the therapeutic efficacy and
safety of a biosimilar could vary from the originator because the
end product is highly dependent on a proprietary manufacturing
process that differs for each manufacturer. Our case suggests that
we may try a switch between reference biologic and its biosimilar
even when an allergic reaction to the originator drug had occurred,
especially when we have a great therapeutic efficacy. However,
more data is needed.

SAFETY OF APREMILAST IN THE TREATMENT OF A
PSORIASIS PATIENT WITH CHRONIC HEPATITIS B

Lazaridou
Second Department of Dermatology-Venereology, Aristotle University
Medical School
Introduction: The treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe
psoriasis in an everyday clinical setting, sometimes, poses serious
challenges. The presence of hepatitis B Virus Infection (HBV) in
these patients complicates the therapeutic choices.
Objectives: We report the case of a female patient, 52 years old,
suffering from moderate-to- severe plaque psoriasis and chronic
hepatitis B.
Methods: She was referred to our outpatient psoriasis clinic with
a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of 13.2. The
patient’s condition has deteriorated the past year but she had not
received any kind of systemic treatment. During our pre-treatment
screening tests she was found HBsAg positive although the liver
function tests were within normal rates. The HBV serological
status of the patient (HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs and
anti-HBe) was estimated. HBV DNA load was measured with the
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method, in order to confirm
that the disease was not active, and it was undetectable.
Results: At that point it was decided to treat the patient with
Apremilast using the standard titration dosing schedule (10mg on
day one and increasing the dose by 10 mg daily) until reaching
the maintenance dose of 30mg twice daily on day 6. Antiviral
treatment was not given to the patient but liver function tests were
performed at a monthly basis and HBV load every three months
during treatment. All these test from the baseline until last observation
(12 months after) were within normal rates. The patient
exhibited an amelioration of her condition from the beginning
which was confirmed by the significant reduction of her PASI score
Poster abstracts 41
Acta Derm Venereol 2018
which reached PSI75 at week 12 and PASI90 at week 24. At the
time of this writing, one year after the initiation of treatment, the
patient remains almost clear from her psoriatic lesions. Apremilast
was well-tolerated by the patient.
Conclusions: The treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis in the
background of chronic HBV limits the therapeutic options due
to the possibility of HBV reactivation when the psoriasis patient
is treated with immunosuppressive or even immunomodulatory
drugs. Apremilast is an oral small-molecule PDE-inhibitor, approved
by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of
moderate-to-severe- plaque psoriasis in 2014. It does not target
any one cytokine but restores a balance of pro-inflammatory and
anti-inflammatory mediators. The pharmacokinetics of Apremilast
is not affected by hepatic impairment and the drug is not
hepatotoxic. Moreover, it is not contraindicated in patients with
active infection. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case
of Apremilast psoriasis patient with chronic inactive Hepatitis B.
It proved to be both safe and efficacious but large, well-organized
studies are needed in order to confirm this conclusion.

IL-22 INDUCES KERATINOCYTES
HYPERPROLIFERATION IN PSORIASIS VIA MIR-21
AND MIR-31 UPREGULATION
Florence Abdallah
Centre de Biophysique Moléculaire, CNRS UPR4301, Orléans, France
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects
people of all ages with an estimated 3% prevalence worldwide.
It manifests as thick red irritated skin lesions due to imbalanced
keratinocytes hyperproliferation and differentiation caused mainly
by increased activation of IL-22 pathway in keratinocytes. Emerging
studies showed a specific psoriatic miRs signature where
miR-21 and miR-31 are one of the most upregulated miRs. The
latters act by favoring cellular proliferation and inflammation.
Hence, re-conciliating the microRNAs and the immunopathogenic
occasions responsible for psoriasis development can be a new
approach for developing effective mechanism and target-based
agents to treat psoriasis.
The common hyper-proliferation effect of IL-22, miR-21 and
miR-31 prompted us to look after a potential interaction between
these actors. The expression levels of those 2 microRNAs and that
of their targets were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo studies in
presence or absence of IL-22.
We first exploited different skin models to investigate a potential
connection between IL-22 and miR-21 or miR-31. The qPCR
analysis showed a significant increase in the relative expression
(RE) of both miRs in the different models upon IL-22 stimulation
during 24h compared to untreated cells. These observations
indicate the implication of miR-21 and miR-31 in proliferationdifferentiation
processes in the different layers of the epidermis.
We also examined the miR-21 target RE PTEN involved in cell
growth and apoptosis control and the miR-31 target RE ppp6c
involved in G1 to S phase transition restriction. In line with the
upregulation of miR-21 and miR-31, IL-22 stimulation resulted
in significant downregulation of both targets at the genomic and
proteomic levels.
We next investigated the in vivo correlation between IL-22 and
miR-21 or miR-31 respectively in the development of psoriatic
lesion. We used the imiquimod-induced psoriasiform skin inflammation
in Wild type and IL-22 deficient mice (known to be almost
protected from IMQ). Mice displaying a less severe disease form
had less miR-21 expression. By contrast, WT mice treated with
IMQ exhibited significantly higher miR-21 RE than IL-22-/- mice.
Furthermore, miR-31 expression in IL-22-/- mice was identical to
miR-31 expression in WT control mice. These results suggest a
direct correlation between IL-22 pathway and miR-31 epidermal
expression. In line with these observations, the miR targets (PTEN
and ppp6c) were contrariwise proportional to miRs expression
confirming by that the specificity of the IL-22/miR-21 and IL-22/
miR-31 correlation.
These findings identify IL-22 as a key regulator of miRs implicated
in multiple signaling pathways that coordinate keratinocytes
proliferation activity

SERUM CONCENTRACION OF IFN-GAMMA IN
PATIENTS WITH PSORIASIS: CORRELATION WITH
CLINICAL TYPE AND SEVERITY OF DISEASE

Bosnia and Herzegovina
Introduction: Psoriasis is a multifactorial chronic inflammatory
disease. The etiopathogenesis of the disease is still unclear but
there is evidence that many of cytokines released by keratinocytes
and inflammatory leukocytes may contribute to the induction or
persistence of the inflammatory process in psoriasis.
Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate serum concentrations
of INF-gamma in patients with psoriasis and the healthy
subjects and also to assess a possible association between IFNgamma,
clinical type and severity of disease.
Methods: The study included a total of 60 patients with psoriasis,
both genders and all of ages. There were 20 healthy subjects in the
control group. According to the clinical type of disease, patients
with psoriasis were divided into four groups: psoriasis vulgaris,
psoriasis pustulosa, psoriasis erythrodermica and psoriasis arthropatica.
Blood samples were collected from all psoriasis patients
and from healthy control subjects. Serum IFN-gamma levels were
measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
technique. The severity of psoriasis vulgaris was assessed by
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score.
Results: Of the total number of patients suffering from psoriasis
42 (70%) had psoriasis vulgaris. The second most frequent was
psoriasis erythrodermica 9 (15%), while 6 (10%) patients had
psoriasis pustulosa and 3 (5%) psoriasis arthropatica. The serum
concentartion of IFN-gamma in patients with psoriasis was significialy
higher than that in the control group (1.91+1.79 pg/ml
vs 0.91+0.38 pg/ml, respectively). Significantly elevated serum
IFN-gamma concentrations were noticed in patients with psoriasis
vulgaris (2.15+0.30 pg/ml), compared with patients suffering from
psoriasis erythrodermica (1.57+0.68 pg/ml), psoriasis arthropatica
(1.33+0.53 pg/ml), and in particular patients suffering from
psoriasis pustulosa (1.08+0.21 pg/ml) who had the lowest mean
serum concentration of IFN-gamma. There was no statistically
significant difference between the mean values of IFN-gamma
compared to the clinical type of psoriasis (p > 0.05). In the group of
patients with psoriasis vulgaris 36 (85.71%) patients had mild form
of disease with PASI < 50, and 6 (14.29%) patients had severe
disease with PASI > 50. It was not found statistically significant
correlation between IFN-gamma and PASI score.
Conclusions: The results of this study showed that psoriasis is
associated with significant changes in serum concentracion of IFNgamma.
There was no statistically significant correlation between
serum IFN-gamma concentracions, clinical type of psoriasis, and
also severity of psoriasis vulgaris evaluated by PASI score.

IMMUNOLOGICAL MEMORY EXISTS IN THE
RECURRENT LESION AND NONRECURRENT SKIN
AFTER REMISSION IN PSORIATIC PATIENTS
Zhu Shen
Institute of Dermatology and Venereology, Sichuan Academy of Medical
Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital
Introduction: Psoriasis usually recurs in previously affected areas,
so a pathogenic memory has been proposed, but the nature of such
site-specific recurrent memory is not completely known. Tissueresident
memory T (TRM) cells are non-recirculating memory T
cells that persist long-term in epithelial tissues, including the skin.
Because they can localize in the skin for many months, we speculate
that TRM may contribute to recurrent pathology of psoriasis.
Objectives: The aim of the present study is to compare the differences
of quantity proportion and secretion ability of cytokines
of the TRM cells between recurrent and nonrecurrent lesions
following remission, as well as to explicit the possible survival
signal for these TRM cells in psoriatic lesion.
Methods: RNA-Seq, Gene Ontology and KEGG analysis, real-time
PCR, flow cytometer analysis/sorting, cell stimulation assay, and
western blot were used to explore the immunological memory.
Results: Compared with normal skin, there are common shared
genes significantly upregulated ( > 2 folds, p < 0.001) by recurrent
and nonrecurrent lesions, including CD69. CD69 mRNA transcription
level in nonrecurrent lesions after remission remains as high
as in neighboring recurrent lesions. CD8+CD69+ TRM cells exist
in both lesions, and they can secret almost same amount of IL-17A
and IL-22 after stimulation. Levels of IL-15, secreted by keratinocytes
in psoriasis epidermis, in nonrecurrent lesions remain as
high as in neighboring recurrent lesions, and recombinant human
IL-15 can induce CD69 on TRM cells.
Conclusions: Our preliminary study shows that CD8+CD69+
TRM cells persist in clinically resolved psoriatic lesions whether it
recurs or not, and they can produce IL-17A and IL-22 with critical
effect on psoriatic recurrence and development. Furthermore, we
have indicated the IL-15 may play crucial role in the survival of
CD8+CD69+ TRM cells in psoriatic lesions.

INVESTIGATING SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION AS THE
COMMON LINK BETWEEN DEPRESSION, PSORIASIS,
AND PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS IN US VETERANS
Samar Gupta1, Alicja Wasilewski2
University of Michigan1, MI State2
Introduction: Psychosocial factors are important in the onset and/
or exacerbation of psoriasis in 40% to 80% of cases. Psoriasis
has been associated with suicide, and an increased prevalence of
alcoholism and a range of personality characteristics.
A recent systematic meta-analysis of 98 eligible studies with a total
of 401,703 psoriasis patients showed that patients with psoriasis
were approximately one and a half times more likely to exhibit
signs of depression compared with healthy controls. [1].
Emerging evidence suggests that depression, like psoriasis, is
associated with systemic inflammation, and the systemic inflammatory
profile of the two conditions show similar traits. Depression
is considered to have a strong inflammatory component, similar to
psoriasis, e.g. interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-12, and tumour necrosis
factor (TNF)-α [2–5].
US Veteran population has increased incidence of mental health
issue as compared to general population. making Veteran group
a unique population that warrants investigation.
Objectives: Hypotheses - 1/ Veterans with concomitant depression
and psoriasis/PsA may have elevated inflammatory markers
like CRP, ESR, and SPEP. 2/ Depression may improve with the
treatment of psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis without antidepressant use.
Methods: A 36-month retrospective chart review of 100 veterans
with diagnosis of depression and psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis.
Elevated inflammatory markers, including sedimentation rate,
C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum protein electrophoresis
(SPEP), as well as longitudinal disease course of depression
(PHQ-8) and psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis (HAQ-DI); specifically
disease activity, and depression symptoms will be assessed. We
then aim to draw a correlation between disease activity and active
depressive symptoms.

Introduction: Small plaque psoriasis (SPP) is a subtype of psoriasis
first described by Griffiths et al (2007). It resembles guttate
psoriasis but lesions are larger, are chronic, and are not associated
with streptococcal infection. We have observed SPP develop in
four different population groups; patients under TNFα-inhibitor
therapy, patients under immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy,
and patients with concurrent SLE or ANA positivity and
psoriasis. Subtypes of psoriasis develop on a spectrum between
autoimmune and auto-inflammatory responses and an interplay
between three signalling pathways are involved in their distinct
pathogenesis. Chronic plaque psoriasis lesions are on the autoimmune
spectrum, dominated by a T-cell mediated TNFα/IL-23/
IL-17/IL-22 axis. Pustular psoriasis is a neutrophilic infiltrative
inflammatory skin disease resulting from dysregulation of the
IL-36/IL-1 axis. Lastly, TNFα-inhibitor (TNFi) induced lesions
have a SPP morphology and demonstrate increased expression
of LL37 by keratinocytes, activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells
and upregulated type-1 interferons (IFN). These lesions express
fewer epidermal CD8 T cells.
Objectives: Our aim is to characterize the immune-phenotype
of SPP in multiple clinical scenarios. We hypothesize that SPP
develops as a result of increased expression of cytokines and
antimicrobial peptides involved in the type-1 IFN pathway.
Methods: Skin biopsies were obtained from three patients with
Poster abstracts 43
Acta Derm Venereol 2018
TNFi-induced psoriasis, three patients with SLE and psoriasis,
three patients with positive ANA and psoriasis, two patients with
ICI-induced psoriasis and two patients with chronic plaque psoriasis
as control. Immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies
against type-1 IFN induced MXA, LL37, IL-36 and CD8 T
cells. The intensity and the area of positively stained samples were
each graded from 0–4 and then multiplied to provide a final score.
Results: Small plaque lesions in various clinical scenarios had histologic
changes consistent with psoriasis.. Immunohistochemical
evaluation revealed an increased expression of MXA (TNFi = 14,
SLE = 13.3, ANA = 11.3, ICI = 16 vs. control = 6, t-test p < 0.05),
LL37 (TNFi = 10.8, SLE = 6, ANA = 9.7, ICI = 12 vs. control = 2,
t-test p < 0.05) and IL-36 (TNFi = 10.5, SLE = 13.3, ANA = 11,
ICI = 7, control = 0.25, t-test p < 0.05) in the keratinocytes of
SPP patients. There was decreased CD8 T cell migration to the
epidermis in SPP compared to control.
Conclusion: This is the first study to describe the immunephenotype
of SPP and to extend the phenotype observed in TNFi
induced psoriasis to varying clinical scenarios. There was an
increased expression of MXA, LL-37 and IL-36 as well as fewer
epidermal CD8 T cells than in chronic plaque psoriasis consistent
with the type-1 IFN pathway of psoriasis pathogenesis. This
immune-phenotypic analysis may suggest tailored therapy for
this form of psoriasis.

Introduction: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory rheumatic
disorder that occurs in patients with psoriasis. The etiology of
PsA is not well understood but evidence supports an interplay of
genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors which promote
pathological bone remodeling and joint damage in PsA. The
glucocorticoid-inducible kinase-1(SGK1) is genomically upregulated
by cell stress. However, excessive SGK1 expression and
activity participates in the pathophysiology of several disorders,
such as inflammation, autoimmune disease, fibrosis, hypertension,
thrombosis and tumor growth.
Objectives: In this study, we analyzed the possible role of serum
SGK-1 levels in the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis.
Methods: 56 patients with psoriasis (40 patients with psoriatic
arthritis; 16 female, 24 male, mean age; 46.7 ± 6.5 years, mean
disease duration 17.7 ± 4.3 years and 16 patients without arthritis; 8
female, 8 male, mean age; 43.2 ± 1.9 years, mean disease duration;
14.1 ± 3.9 years) and 19 healthy controls (11 female, 8 male; mean
age 41.3 ± 4.7 years) were enrolled in this study. Oligoarthritis was
the commonest clinical presentation (76.4 %). Dactylitis (73.4%)
and enthesitis (48.1%) were frequent extra-articular features.
All patients were negative for rheumatoid factor. HLA-B27 was
negative in 14 patients. Serum SGK-1 levels were determined
by ELISA.
Results: The mean serum SGK-1 levels were 58.4 ± 18.1 pg/ml in
healthy controls, 163.7 ± 27.8 pg/ml in patients without arthritis
and 443.9 ± 32.1 pg/ml in patients with arthritis. Serum SGK-1
levels were significantly high in patients with psoriasis compared
with healthy controls (p < 0.001). Serum SGK-1 levels were significantly
high in patients with psoriatic arthritis compared with
in patients without psoriatic arthritis (p < 0.001).
Conclusions: The evidence is strong that immunological mechanisms
are involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. In this study,
we demonstrated that serum SGK-1 levels were significantly
elevated in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.

DIFFERENTIAL NH2-TERMINAL AUTOANTIGEN
TRIMMING MAY EXPLAIN EPISTASIS BETWEEN
HLA-C*06:02 AND ERAP1 VARIANTS IN PSORIASIS
RISK

Introduction: NH2-terminal trimming by endoplasmic reticulum
aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) generates the appropriate length of
antigenic peptides for binding to and presentation by HLA-class
I molecules. Genetic interaction between ERAP1 variants and
HLA-class I alleles determines the genetic risk for various HLAclass
I-associated inflammatory diseases. Epistasis between HLAC*
06:02 and ERAP1 variants affects also psoriasis risk but the
mechanisms of these gene interactions remained unknown. Using
a pathogenic Vα3S1/Vβ13S1-TCR from a psoriatic CD8+ T-cell
clone we had shown that in psoriasis, HLA-C*06:02 mediates an
autoimmune response against melanocytes through autoantigen
presentation and we had identified a peptide from ADAMTS-like
protein 5 (ADAMTSL5) as HLA-C*06:02-presented melanocyte
autoantigen.
Objectives: To determine the role of ERAP1 variants in psoriasis
pathogenesis.
Methods: We established ERAP1 knockout cells using CRISPR/
Cas9 system. ERAP1 knockout cells transfected with plasmids
coding for HLA-C*06:02, ERAP1 variants, and antigenic peptides
were co-cultured with the TCR hybridoma to determine
the levels of TCR ligation which reflect the generation of the
antigenic ADAMTSL5 peptide and other Vα3S1/Vβ13S1-TCR
ligands from precursors.
Results: Our data show that NH2-terminal trimming by ERPA1
is required to generate the actual antigenic ADAMTSL5 peptide
from NH2-terminally elongated precursors. An ERAP1 variant
protecting from psoriasis reduced the immunogenicity of the
antigenic ADAMTSL5 peptide presumably through overtrimming
and peptide destruction, whereas a psoriasis risk variant of ERAP1
highly kept the antigenicity of the autoantigen. This effect was
specific for ADAMTSL5. Precursors of other Vα3S1/Vβ13S1-
TCR self-ligands were not substrates of ERAP1.
Conclusions: Using a proven psoriatic autoantigen and a cognate
psoriatic TCR, these experiments provide direct evidence that
gene-gene interaction between ERAP1 and HLA-C*06:02 affects
the risk for psoriasis through differential autoantigen trimming
from precursors. These data furthermore propose a model where
ERAP1 function essentially controls the autoantigenic potential
of self-peptides in HLA-class I associated CD8+ T-cell mediated
autoimmune diseases.

ENVIRONMENTAL TRIGGERS OF AN HLA-C*06:02-
RESTRICTED AUTOIMMUNE RESPONSE IN PSORIASIS
Secil Vural, Yukiyasu Arakawa, Adrian Galinski, Sigrid Vollmer,
Akiko Arakawa, Jörg Prinz
Ludwig Maximilian University
Introduction: Psoriasis vulgaris is a multifactorial disease. While
the major psoriasis risk gene HLA-C*06:02 accounts for up to
50% of disease onset, environmental factors are considered to
contribute to approximately 30% of disease risk. Psoriatic skin
inflammation is driven by an HLA-C*06:02-mediated autoimmune
response against melanocytes. A pathogenic Vα3S1/Vβ13S1 T-cell
receptor (TCR), which we had reconstituted from a lesional epidermal
CD8+ T-cell clone of an HLA-C*06:02–positive psoriasis
patient in a mouse reporter hybridoma cell line, specifically reacts
against melanocytes through HLA-C*06:02 restricted recognition
of a psoriatic melanocyte autoantigen, ADAMTS-like protein 5
(ADAMTSL5). However, it is unknown whether and how environ44

mental factors may contribute to autoimmunity in psoriasis. TCRs
are known to be polyspecific, recognizing multiple peptide ligands
which share a conserved amino acid pattern specific for each TCR.
Objectives: To examine the potential role of environmental factors
in the psoriatic autoimmune response.
Methods: We first determined the particular amino acid motif
which is recognized by the psoriatic Vα3S1/Vβ13S1 TCR in
the context of HLA-C*06:02. By homology searches using this
conserved amino acid pattern, we selected 57 peptides from
food, bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens and from the skin and
intestinal microbiomes as candidate environmental antigens that
may trigger the psoriatic autoimmune response. We cloned the
peptides into expression plasmids, co-transfected them with HLAC*
06:02 into Cos7 cells and used them to stimulate the Vα3S1/
Vβ13S1 TCR. TCR ligation was determined by GFP induction
of TCR hybridoma in FACS analysis. We then stimulated blood
lymphocytes with the candidate peptides that had ligated the
Vα3S1/Vβ13S1 TCR. Lymphocyte activation was assessed by
induction of activation markers and proliferation assays using
thymidine incorporation.
Results: We identified a variety of peptides contained in proteins
from food (wheat, coffee, apple, and spinach), microbiota of human
skin or gut, and infectious pathogens including Chlamydia
trachomatis, which ligated the psoriatic TCR in a polyspecific
manner. Stimulation of blood lymphocytes with particular candidate
antigens resulted in significant activation in psoriasis patients,
as compared to healthy individuals. Interindividual-correlation
analyses demonstrated cross-reactive immune responses between
environmental antigens and the melanocyte autoantigen presented
by HLA-C*06:02 in psoriasis patients. Among the candidate
antigens, wheat peptides induced most robust lymphocyte activations
in psoriasis patients. Moreover, psoriasis was significantly
improved by wheat-free diet in several patients with lymphocytes
responding to wheat, indicating potential pathogenic contribution
of wheat antigens in psoriasis.
Conclusions: Our results provide unbiased evidence that several
environmental antigens may trigger the melanocyte-specific
autoimmune response in psoriasis. By identifying and avoiding
those triggers at the molecular level which translate the genetic
predisposition into disease manifestation, we may develop strategies
to prevent disease onset and exacerbation.

Sweden
Background: Psoriasis lesions evolve as a result of cytokine driven
interactions between intralesional immune cells and keratinocytes
in genetically predisposed individuals. Skin resident T cells are
implicated in maintenance and recurrence of psoriasis plaques
but their composition and function in never-lesional psoriasis
skin is less known.
Objective:Characterisation of T cell driven tissue responses and
subsets of resident T cells in never-lesional psoriasis.
Methods: T cell driven tissue responses were assessed in explanted
skin biopsies using Nanostring and Multiplex analysis. Epidermal
and dermal T cells were characterised using flow cytometry in
never-lesional skin from patients with mild disease.
Results: T cell activation induced epidermal psoriasiform- and
type-1 interferon tissue responses in explants from never-lesional
skin. Skin resident T cells were skewed with enrichment
of epidermal IL-17 and IL-22 producing CD4+CCR6+ and
CD8+CD103+CD49a- T cells and IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells
in never-lesional skin compared to healthy skin. Keratinocytes
from never-lesional psoriasis responded to IFN-γ activation with
IFN-α secretion and MX1 upregulation and skin explants exposed
to common fungal antigens produced the CCR6-attractant CCL20.
Conclusion: Resident T cells poised to induce psoriasiform tissue
responses accumulate in never-lesional skin of psoriasis-afflicted
individuals. Additionally our data suggest that microbial interplay
with genetically predisposed keratinocytes may shape the local
pool of resident T cells.

Introduction: Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) arises in an increased burden
of psoriasis and impairments in both quality of life and functional
capacity. The relationship between nail involvement and PsA in
psoriasis is not fully characterized.
Objective:To evaluate the frequency and characteristics of nail
involvement in psoriatic patients and to assess the relationship
with joint involvement.
Methods: A total of 197 patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis,
were consecutively selected to participate in this cross-sectional
study. The patients divided into two groups; with and without
psoriatic arthritis.
Results: 69.5% of psoriatic (137 out of 197) patients had nail involvement.
The most common nail abnormality was onycholysis,
followed by pitting and oil drop. Nail changes were more common
in patients with psoriatic arthritis (82.1% vs. 57.8%).
Limitations: Our study had certain limitations. One of them was
lack of information about the subtypes of PsA. Also, we have not
recorded the severity of nail involvements. Furthermore, previous
medications may have interfered with the degree of nail changes
in our patients.
Conclusion: Nail involvement is associated with PsA. Onycholysis,
splinter hemorrhage, and oil drop were significantly more
common in PsA group. In general, psoriatic patients with arthritis
had the more severe disease.

Introduction and Objectives: Ixekizumab (IXE), an interleukin-
17A antagonist, has shown superior efficacy in psoriasis compared
to placebo,1 etanercept,1 and ustekinumab.2 This post hoc
analysis intended to evaluate absolute and relative Psoriasis Area
and Severity Index (PASI) improvements with IXE treatment in
a phase 3 trial (IXORAP).
Methods: In IXORA-P, patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis
were randomized (2:1:1) to receive any of the 3 dosing regimens
of IXE 80 mg: every 2 weeks (Q2W; n = 611), every 4 weeks
(Q4W; n = 310), or Q4W/Q2W step-up (n = 306), for 52 weeks.
Randomization was stratified by country and weight ( < 80 kg, ≥80
to < 100 kg, or ≥100 kg). The percentage of patients achieving a
75%, 90% or 100% improvement from baseline in PASI (PASI
75, 90, and 100) was evaluated using logistic regression with
dosing regimen, country, and baseline weight as factors. Fisher’s
exact test with nonresponder imputation was used to compare the
response rates between treatment groups. Here, we present results
at 12 weeks for Q2W (label dose) and Q4W groups; results from
Q4W/Q2W group will be discussed separately.
Results: Mean (standard deviation) PASI score at baseline was
20.3 (8.25). Response rates were significantly higher (p < 0.001)
for Q2W group compared to Q4W group across all cut-off points
for absolute PASI: absolute PASI ≤ 1, 2, 3, and 5 response rates at
Week 12 were 61.4%, 76.1%, 84.5%, and 89.4%, respectively, for
Q2W group, and 49.7%, 64.5%, 72.6%, and 83.9%, respectively,
for Q4W group. At Week 12, PASI 75 response rates in Q2W and
Q4W groups were 89.2% and 83.2%, respectively (p = 0.012).
For Q2W and Q4W groups, PASI 90 response rates were 75.3%
and 63.2%, respectively (p < 0.001), and PASI 100 response rates
were 46.0% and 32.6%, respectively (p < 0.001).
Conclusion: As reported in psoriasis registration trials, induction
with IXE Q2W, the labeled dosing regimen, provides better clinical
outcomes at Week 12.

Background: Prevalence of psoriatic arthritis in patients with
psoriasis has conflicting data in different population. But no
study has been performed in Russian population of prevalence
and sex differences of psoriatic arthritis in patients with severe
plaque psoriasis.
Objectives: to evaluate the prevalence PsA in patients (pts) with
PsO in a dermatological hospital cohort.
Methods: 890 pts (Male-516/Female-374) with severy plaque
PsO, mean age 50.4±17.6 years, mean PsO duration 21.5±14.7,
mean PASI 49.4±0.5 were included. 374 female were divided into
groups by age. 113 young F. pts with age less than 49 years (mean
age 36.1±11.0 years), 261 old F. pts with age more than 50 years
(mean age 63.7±9.6 years). 516 male were divided into groups
by age. 304 young M. pts with age less than 54 years (mean age
38.5±11.3 years), 212 old M. pts with age more than 55 years
(mean age 38.5±11.3 years) were included. PsO and PsA pts were
identify in hospital Database reporting and coding by International
Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems
(ICD-10) between 2010 - 2015 years. PSA was diagnosed after
appointment with a rheumatologist and an X-ray examination.
Diagnosis was carried out according to the criteria of CASPAR.
M±m, t-test, x2, (%) were calculated. All p < 0.05 were considered
to indicate statistical significance.
Results: 303 out of 890 pts (34.0%) had psoriatic arthritis (PsA).
PsA pts were older then PsO pts without arthritis – 55.3±13.7 years
and 50.4±17.6 years accordingly (p < 0.001). PsA was found significantly
often in F. pts compare to M. pts – in 143 out of 374 pts
(38.2%) and in 129 out of 516 pts (25.0%) accordingly (p < 0.05).
PsA was found significantly often in F. pts over 50 years old (y.o.)
compare to F. pts under 50 y.o. – in 134 out of 261 pts (51.3%) and
in 9 out of 113 pts (7.9%) accordingly (p < 0.05). In old M. and
young M. PsA was found in the same cases - in 58 out of 212 pts
(27.3%) and in 71 out of 304 pts (23.3%) accordingly (p > 0.05).
Conclusions: PsA was detected in more than a third of patients
with severe plaque psoriasis. PSA was found predominantly often
in F. pts over 50 years of age with severe plaque psoriasis. Future
investigation in this field is needed to determine the causes of high
risks PSA in this age group.

SKIN LESION SEVERITY IN EARLY AXIAL AND
PERIPHERAL PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS PATIENTS
Elena Gubar, Elena Loginova, Svetlana Glukhova, Tatiana Korotaeva
Nasonova Research Institute of Rheumatology, Moscow
Introduction: Comparative analysis of skin lesion severity in early
PsA patients with and without axial involvement hadn’t been sufficiently
studied.
Objective:to compare skin lesion severity of two early peripheral
PsA patient populations – with and without axial involvement.
Methods: 95 patients (pts) (M/F–47 /48) with early PsA according
to CASPAR criteria were included; all pts had peripheral arthritis
for ≤ 2 years; no inflammatory back pain (IBP) pts were specially
selected. Mean age 36.5±10.7 yrs, disease duration 12.2±10.3
mo, disease activity indexes DAS = 4.0±1.4, DAS28 = 4.2± 1.1,
BASDAI = 4.5±1.6. Skin lesion severity was evaluated in terms
of body surface area (BSA) affected and Psoriasis Area Severity
Index (PASI). When BSA was ≥3%, PASI was calculated. PASI
≥11 indicates moderate and severe psoriasis.
All pts were evaluated for the presence of inflammatory back pain
(IBP) by ASAS criteria. IBP was observed in 63 (66.3%) cases.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of SIJs was performed in 79
pts, regardless of the presence of IBP, on Signa Ovation 0,35T. MRI
results were evaluated by an independent reader. Bone marrow
edema on MRI (STIR) was considered as active MRI sacroiliitis
(MRI-SI). MRI-SI was detected in 28 of 79 (35.4%) examined
cases. The examination also included X-ray of sacroiliac joints
(SIJs) (pelvic radiographs). Radiographic sacroiliitis (R-SI) was
considered according to New York criteria (unilateral grade≥3 or
bilateral grade≥2). R-SI was found in 29 (30.5%) cases. Pts were
split into two groups: those with axial involvement (axPsA), that
is with IBP and/or MRI-SI and/or R-SI; and those without axial
involvement (having only peripheral PsA [pPsA]). The axPsA
group included 65 (68.4%) cases, the pPsA one 30 (31.6%) cases.
Results: skin lesions’ severity was higher in the axPsA group than
in the pPsA group: in axPsA pts BSA median was 3.0 [1.0 – 9.0]
and in pPsA pts it was 1.0 [0.2 – 3.0] (р = 0.007); in the axPsA
group PASI median was 15.6 [6.6 – 55.2] and in the pPsA group
it was 6.0 [0.0 – 7.2] (р = 0.006).
Conclusion: Axial involvement in early PsA patients is associated
with skin lesions’ severity. These findings may have a positive
impact on the selection of the best therapeutic strategy.

Background/Objective:Patients with moderate-to-severe plaque
psoriasis (PsO) are at increased risk of developing inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD). A survey was conducted to evaluate the
prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in PsO patients.
Methods: An electronic survey was available to U.S. PsO patients
with data collected from Jan-Feb. 2017. Patients with moderateto-
severe plaque PsO and healthy controls (HC), with common
co-morbidities allowed in both groups qualified for inclusion in
the survey. Psoriasis patients were further categorized as those
without recent exposure to biologic therapy (PsO-) vs those with
recent (within 4 months) biologic exposure (PsO+). GI symptoms
and signs, including frequency and severity, were compared across
groups. CalproQuest (CPQ) scores, which have recently been proposed
as a tool to identify patients with elevated fecal calprotectin
levels and increased risk for IBD, were also calculated. Patients
with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), inflammatory bowel
syndrome (IBS), or other gastrointestinal (GI) diagnoses with
symptoms that overlap with IBD were excluded.
Results: Overall, 915 patients with self-reported moderate-severe
PsO and 1,411 healthy controls participated. Demographics were
generally comparable between groups. GI symptoms and signs
were significantly more prevalent in the PsO- and PsO+ groups
vs the HC group, respectively: pain- 20.6% and 36.9% vs 10.5%;
fullness/bloating- 37.2% and 48.4% vs 25.3%; and diarrhea (16.3%
and 29.3% vs 12.2% (all p-values = 0.002 except diarrhea for
PsO- vs HC, p = 0.023). Mucous and blood in the stool followed
a similar pattern. A significantly greater percentage of PsO- and
PsO+ patients had positive CPQ scores vs HCs, with the greatest
percentage of positive CPQ scores in the PsO+ group.
Conclusion: GI symptoms and signs are common in patients with
moderate-to-severe PsO, more so than in healthy controls. This
suggests that physicians caring for patients with PsO may consider
assessing for GI symptoms and signs, and monitoring for their
progression with treatment of PsO to identify patients potentially
at risk for developing IBD.

Introduction and Objectives: Psoriasis is a condition typically
requiring long-term treatment, thus longitudinal data establishing
the safety of approved therapies are required. We report exposure
adjusted incidence rates (IRs per 100 patient years) for treatmentemergent
adverse events (AEs) per year of treatment from a pooled
analysis of all secukinumab psoriasis trials to date (19 studies,
4,674 patients, 10,061 patient-years exposure; secukinumab
exposure up to 5 years).
Methods: AE IRs were examined per year for subjects receiving
secukinumab, and for 52 weeks only for those receiving etanercept
(ETN), ustekinumab (UST), or placebo (PBO).
Results: Duration of exposure through 52 weeks of secukinumab
treatment 300 mg, ETN 50 mg, UST 45/90 mg, and PBO was
1467.4, 296.9, 318.1, and 301 patient-years, respectively. Exposure
duration through 2, 3, 4, and 5 years of secukinumab 300 mg
treatment was 859.6, 423, 377.5, and 90 patient-years.
Over 52 weeks for secukinumab, ETN, UST, and PBO, respectively,
exposure adjusted IRs were overall comparable across treatments:
total AEs (275.6, 245.7, 252.2, 355.8); nasopharyngitis (28.4, 35.9,
31.2, 35.9); headache (12.6, 15, 14.6, 23.7); upper respiratory
infections [URI] (9.1, 5.9, 9.9, 8.8); opportunistic infections (0.2,
0.3, 0.3, 0.3); Candida infections (4.7, 1.4, 1.6, 1.7); neutropenia
(0.5, 1.4, 0, 0); major adverse cardiovascular events [MACE] (0.5,
0.3, 0.3, 1.3); Crohn’s disease (0.1, 0, 0, 0); ulcerative colitis (0.1,
0.3, 0, 0); and malignant or unspecified tumors [excluding nonmelanoma
skin cancer [NMSC]] (0.4, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3).
Secukinumab 300 mg pooled safety remained favorable over time
with no increases in AEs (exposure adjusted IRs for up to Year
1 to Year 5, respectively): total AEs (275.6, 168.1, 160.2, 111.9,
13.9); nasopharyngitis (28.4, 21.2, 24.1, 11.8, 3.4); headache
(12.6, 5.4, 4.3, 4.9, 0); URI (9.1, 7.3, 6.1, 5.5, 0); opportunistic
infections (0.2, 0.1, 0, 0, 0); Candida infections (4.7, 3.6, 1.9, 1.3,
1.1); neutropenia (0.5, 0.1, 0, 0, 0); MACE (0.5, 0.1, 0.5, 0, 0);
Crohn’s disease (0.1, 0, 0, 0, 0); ulcerative colitis (0.1, 0.4, 0.2,
0.3, 0); and malignant or unspecified tumors [excluding NMSC]
(0.4, 0.4, 0.2, 0, 0).
Conclusions: This comprehensive pooled analysis supports the
favorable long-term safety profile of secukinumab in patients with
psoriasis; no new safety signals were identified for up to 5 years
of treatment and secukinumab’s safety profile was consistent with
that established in a large phase 3 program.

Introduction: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic immunemediated
inflammatory disease affecting peripheral and axial
joints. For patients with active psoriasis, the added burden of skin
disease can further reduce health-related quality of life (HRQoL)
of patients with joint disease.
Objective:To determine the contribution of joint and skin improvements
in HRQoL of patients with active PsA during Phase 3
clinical trials investigating ixekizumab (IXE) treatment.
Methods: The double-blind Phase 3 trials (SPIRIT) investigated
the treatment of IXE, a high-affinity monoclonal antibody selectively
targeting interleukin-17A, for patients with active PsA.
The integrated database of 2 SPIRIT trials consisted of biologic
disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)-naïve patients
(SPIRIT-P1, NCT01695239) or inadequate responders to tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitors (SPIRIT-P2, NCT02349295).
Patients were randomized to 80mg IXE every 4 weeks (Q4W,
Poster abstracts 47
Acta Derm Venereol 2018
n = 229) or 2 weeks (Q2W, n = 226) after a 160mg starting dose or
placebo (PBO, n = 224). At baseline and Week 24, joint and skin
diseases were measured by the Disease Activity index for PSoriatic
Arthritis (DAPSA; calculated post-hoc) and Psoriasis Area
and Severity Index (PASI), respectively. HRQoL was measured
by EuroQoL 5 Dimensions Visual Analog Scale (EQ-5D VAS),
Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36), and Work Productivity
and Activity Impairment-Specific Health Problem (WPAI). The
synergistic contribution of skin and joint improvements to HRQoL
was modeled using smoothing spline method and depicted with
response surface. Missing data were imputed using last observation
carried forward.
Results: Of 679 PBO- and IXE-treated patients in the SPIRIT
trials, 402 (65%) and 224 (36%) patients had ≥3% body surface
area (BSA) and ≥10% BSA psoriasis at baseline, respectively. In
these patients, we applied response surface modeling to investigate
the relationship among DAPSA, PASI, and change from baseline
in EQ-5D VAS at Week 24. The greatest improvement in EQ-5D
VAS was associated with the largest percent improvements in
both DAPSA and PASI together, rather than DAPSA or PASI
alone. Similar observations, regardless of ≥3% or ≥10% BSA baseline
psoriasis, were made in domains of SF-36 (General Health,
Physical Functioning, Social Functioning, and Vitality; data not
shown) and WPAI (Activity Impairment; data not shown).
Conclusion: For PsA patients with psoriasis, optimal improvements
in patients’ HRQoL, as measured by select domains of
patient-reported outcomes, were dependent on successful treatment
of both joint and skin symptoms.

Introduction: Palmoplantar psoriasis (ppPsO) occurs in up to 40%
of plaque psoriasis subjects and is often resistant to treatment. It
is associated with pain, functional limitations, and greater impairment
of health related quality of life compared with plaque psoriasis
on other parts of the body (1). Secukinumab, a fully human
monoclonal antibody which selectively neutralises IL-17A, has
shown long lasting efficacy and safety in the complete spectrum
of psoriasis manifestations, including nails, scalp, palms and soles
and psoriatic arthritis.
Objectives: Here we report, the long-term follow-up efficacy and
safety results from the GESTURE study, the first robust (2.5-year)
data reported in subjects with moderate to severe ppPsO treated
with secukinumab.
Methods: GESTURE is a double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled,
parallel-group, multicentre phase 3b study to investigate
safety and efficacy of secukinumab 150 and 300 mg s.c. in 205
subjects with moderate to severe ppPsO.
Results: As previously reported, after 16 weeks placebo-controlled
treatment, the primary endpoint palmoplantar Investigator’s Global
Assessment (ppIGA) 0/1 and all secondary endpoints of this study
were met, demonstrating superiority of secukinumab to placebo
at week 16 (2). An interim analysis at week 80 established the
continuation improvement of palmoplantar disease for all efficacy
parameters. The effect was sustained through 2.5 years with
59.2% and 52.5% of subjects in secukinumab 300 and 150 mg
groups, respectively [multiple imputation (MI)] achieving clear
or almost clear palms and soles (ppIGA 0/1). Consistent with this
observation, the mean palmoplantar Psoriasis Area and Severity
Index % change from baseline reached –74.7% and –61.6% for
secukinumab 300 and 150 mg, respectively, at 2.5 years (MI).
The Dermatology Life Quality Index 0/1 response, was achieved
in 45.5% vs. 23.9% of subjects for secukinumab 300 and 150
mg groups respectively (LOCF). Pain and function of palms and
soles was markedly improved with secukinumab; as reflected by
the Palmoplantar Quality of Life Instrument overall scores with
16.7% and 17.9% subjects experiencing no difficulty in hand and
feet functionality in secukinumab 300 mg and 150 mg groups
respectively (LOCF). The safety profile was consistent with that
seen in secukinumab phase 3 trials. The most common adverse
events across all treatment arms were nasopharyngitis, upper
respiratory tract infection and headache.
Conclusions: GESTURE, the largest and longest duration randomised
controlled trial to date, revealed that secukinumab provides
a novel treatment option for the challenging and infrequently
studied ppPsO population by providing a strong and sustained
response through 2.5 years.

Introduction: Nail psoriasis is associated with decreased finger
mobility, functional impairment, pain and reduced quality of life
(QoL) and is often challenging to treat. It correlates with more
severe psoriatic disease and is an important predictor of psoriatic
arthritis (PsA). Nails are affected in up to 50% of psoriasis patients,
with a lifetime incidence as high as 90%1. Secukinumab, a fully
human monoclonal antibody that selectively neutralises IL-17A,
has shown long lasting efficacy and safety in the complete spectrum
of psoriasis manifestations, including nails, scalp, palms and
soles and psoriatic arthritis.
Objectives: Here, we report the long-term follow-up efficacy and
safety results from the TRANSFIGURE study, the first robust
(2.5-year) data reported in subjects with nail psoriasis treated
with secukinumab.
Methods: TRANSFIGURE is a double blind, randomised,
placebo-controlled, parallel group, multi-centre phase 3b study,
to investigate safety and efficacy of secukinumab 150 and 300 mg
s.c. in moderate to severe nail psoriasis, involving 198 subjects.
Results: As previously reported, at week 16 the primary endpoint
NAPSI (NAil Psoriasis Severity Index) and all secondary
endpoints of this study was met, demonstrating superiority of
secukinumab to placebo after 16 weeks placebo-controlled treat48

ment2. An interim analysis at week 80 demonstrated the continuation
of improvement in nail psoriasis for all efficacy parameters.
The effect was sustained through 2.5 years with a large mean
NAPSI improvement from baseline (BL) of −73.3% and −63.6%
with secukinumab 300 and 150 mg, respectively (as observed).
Secukinumab demonstrated sustained reductions (improvements)
in total mean NAPPA (Nail Assessment in Psoriasis and Psoriatic
Arthritis) QoL scores from BL to 2.5 years by −52.4% and
−18.1%, and 70.2% and 71.0% of subjects achieved a weighted
NAPPA-PBI (Patient Benefit Index) global score of ≥2 (at least
moderate benefits) with secukinumab 300 and 150 mg, respectively
(LOCF). Subjects showed considerable improvements in
EQ-5D (EuroQOL 5-Dimension Health Status Questionnaire)
compared with BL reporting decreased pain and discomfort. The
safety profile was consistent with that observed in previous phase
3 trials of psoriasis and PsA.
Conclusions: TRANSFIGURE is the first large, randomised controlled
trial to report long-term results in subjects with nail psoriasis.
Secukinumab demonstrated strong sustainability of clinically
meaningful efficacy, large QoL improvement and a favourable
safety profile up to 2.5 years in this challenging form of psoriasis.

THE OBESITY AND PREVALENCE PSORIATIC
ARTHRITIS IN PATIENTS WITH PLAQUE PSORIASIS:
DERMATOLOGICAL REAL-SETTING DATA
Maria Chamurlieva, Tatiana Korotaeva
N.A.Nasonova Research Institute of Rheumatology
Background: Psoriasis (PsO) is a chronic inflammatory disease,
which can be associated with the obesity. A link between body
mass index (BMI) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) has been found
recently. But there is limited data about this association in Russian
population and from real-world data.
Objective:To study the incidence of PsA in PsO patients (pts)
with/without obesity.
Methods: 103 pts (male-47/female-56) with different forms of
plaque PsO, mean age 44±13.69 years (yrs.), mean PsO duration
10.7±10.2 yrs., mean PASI 15.39±12.51 were included. 61 out of
103 pts with PsO (59.2%) had psoriatic arthritis (PsA) by CASPAR
criteria. In all pts BMI was calculated. If the BMI was more than
30 it was regarded as obesity. M±m, %, t-test were peformed. All
p < 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.
Results: The overweight in both groups of pts with PsO and PsA
was not significantly different: in 30 pts without PsA and in 48
with PsA, 71.4% and 78.7% respectively. However, there was a
significant difference in the frequency of PsA in the group of pts
with a BMI = 30–35 (obesity 1 degree). Thus, it was more than 4
times higher the pts with PsA, compared with pts without PsA - 19
and 4 pts (31.2% vs. 9.5%) respectively (p = 0.06).
Conclusion: There is a higher incidence of PsA in PsO pts with
obesity. It should be taken into account during choice of treatment
and evaluation of efficiency of therapy in real-world dermatological
setting. Russian population – based studies are needed.

Introduction: Secukinumab (SEC) is a fully human monoclonal
antibody that selectively neutralizes IL-17A, a key cytokine
involved in the development of psoriasis (PsO). SEC has shown
long lasting efficacy and safety in the complete spectrum of PsO
manifestations, including nails, scalp, palms and soles and psoriatic
arthritis (PsA). PURE is an international registry of adult patients
(pts) from Canada and Latin America with moderate to severe PsO
treated with SEC vs other approved therapies (other Tx).
Objectives: To describe and compare the baseline demographic,
disease, and clinical characteristics – specifically, the history of
a PsA diagnosis among PsO pts treated with SEC vs other Tx.
Methods: Approximately 2,500 adult pts (1:1 ratio, SEC: other Tx)
will be recruited. A decision regarding treatment must have been
reached prior to enrollment. The independent-samples and Chisquare
tests were used for continuous and categorical variables,
respectively, for treatment group comparison.
Results: As of Nov 27, 2017, 1032 pts (397 SEC vs 635 other Tx)
had been enrolled. Mean age (50.5 vs 49.4 years), time since diagnosis
(18.5 vs 16.9 years), duration since symptom onset (20.5 vs
19 years), and race (78.6% vs 83.8% Caucasian) were comparable
between groups. The percentage of females was lower in the SEC
group (38.0%) vs other Tx (45.5%; p = 0.037). At baseline, the
majority of SEC-treated pts (66.2%) were employed, and 23.7%
vs 34.8% vs 34.3% had public vs private vs combined coverage,
respectively. There was no difference between cohorts. A higher
proportion of SEC pts had a history of PsA (23.2% vs 15.0%;
p = 0.001) or diabetes (18.1% vs 13.4%; p = 0.072) compared to pts
on other Tx. About 87.9% pts with PsA history and 34.1% pts without
had a Psoriasis Epidemiology Screening Tool (PEST) score
≥3 at baseline; however, the diagnosis of PsA in these pts needs to
be confirmed. In terms of prior PsO treatments, 52.4% vs 29.9%
(p < 0.001) of SEC vs other Tx pts had been previously treated
with methotrexate, and 50.6% vs 18.0% (p < 0.001) with a biologic.
Prior to enrollment, 4.7%, 13.2% and 4.7% pts in the other
Tx group received anti-IL-12/23, anti-TNF-α, and anti-IL-17A,
respectively. Pts treated with SEC had a higher historical Psoriasis
Area and Severity Index (PASI) score (16.5 vs 14.2; p = 0.005),
baseline PASI (13.6 vs 12.0; p = 0.001) and Investigator’s Global
Assessment score (severe disease [score = 4]: 25.4% vs 20.1%)
at enrollment compared to pts on other Tx.
Conclusions: Pts with moderate to severe PsO selected for treatment
with SEC were more likely to have been previously exposed
to another biologic, have comorbid PsA and had more severe
skin disease, compared to pts treated with other Tx. A significant
proportion of PsO pts may have their PsA undiagnosed in routine
clinical care.

Introduction/Objective:To evaluate the efficacy, safety & tolerability
of guselkumab (GUS) in patients (pts) w/ PsA.
Methods: In this double-blind, PBO-controlled study, pts w/active
PsA & ≥3% BSA of PsO despite treatment were randomized 2:1
to SC GUS 100mg or PBO at wks0, 4, & q8w thereafter through
wk44. At wk16, pts w/ < 5% improvement from baseline (BL)
in swollen & tender joint counts were eligible for early escape
(EE) to open-label ustekinumab. At wk24, PBO pts crossed-over
to GUS 100mg (PBO to GUS). The primary endpoint was ACR
20 at wk24. Major secondary endpoints were PASI 75 & ACR
50 responses, change from BL in HAQ-DI, & improvement in
enthesitis (Leeds enthesitis index [LEI]) & dactylitis score (by
a 0–3 scoring system) at wk24; & ACR 20 response at wk16.
Through wk24, efficacy analyses were performed in a modified
Intent-to-Treat (mITT) population. Pts who met treatment failure
criteria, EE or had missing data at wk24 were considered nonresponders
for ACR/MDA endpoints at wk24. Efficacy post wk24
was evaluated in pts who did not EE & continued treatment at
wk24 based on observed data.
Results: Of 149 pts (PBO:49, GUS:100), BL demographics & ACR
component measures were generally similar between the 2 groups.
4 PBO & 9 GUS pts were previously exposed to anti-TNFα agents.
At wk24, significantly more GUS pts achieved ACR 20 (58.0% vs
18.4%, p < 0.001), PASI 75 (78.6% vs 12.5%, p < 0.001), & ACR
50 (34.0% vs 10.2%, p = 0.002) responses vs PBO. At wk24, mean
decrease in HAQ-DI score from BL (-0.42 vs. -0.06, p < 0.001),
& median percent improvement in enthesitis (100% vs 33.33%,
p = 0.009) & dactylitis (100% vs 33.33%, p < 0.001) scores (among
pts w/ BL enthesitis and dactylitis) were significantly greater in
GUS group vs. PBO. Significantly more GUS pts achieved ACR
20 at wk16 (60.0% vs 16.3%, p < 0.001) and MDA at wk24 (23.0%
vs. 2.0%, p = 0.001) vs. PBO. Post wk24, efficacy improved in
PBO to GUS crossover pts as expected and were well-maintained
in GUS pts through wk56.
Through wk24, the frequencies of AEs & infections were comparable
(AEs: PBO 32.7%; GUS 36.0%; infections: PBO: 20.4%;
GUS: 16.0%). Post wk24, there was no disproportional increase
in AE frequency or infections among GUS pts w/ longer exposure.
Through wk56, there was 1 malignancy (basal cell carcinoma), 6
SAEs (myocardial infarction, osteoarthritis, pupils unequal, radius
fracture, pneumonia, ulcerative keratitis), 2 pts discontinued treatment
due to AEs, 1 grade 3 neutropenia, & 6 pts were positive for
antibodies to GUS. No deaths occurred through wk56.
Conclusions: GUS demonstrated significant improvement on joint
symptoms, physical function, PsO, enthesitis, dactylitis & quality
of life; efficacy was well-maintained through wk56. GUS was well
tolerated in this population after ~1 year of exposure.

Introduction: Tildrakizumab (TIL), a humanized, IgG1/κ monoclonal
antibody for IL-23p19, recently demonstrated its efficacy
in subjects with chronic plaque psoriasis in two, phase 3 clinical
studies1.
Objective:In this analysis, we examined efficacy from baseline
to week 52 among TIL patients achieving various Psoriasis Area
and Severity Index (PASI) responses at week 28.
Methods: ReSURFACE 1 (NCT01722331) and reSURFACE 2
(NCT01729754) were double-blind, randomized controlled studies
in subjects with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Part
1 (0–12 weeks) was placebo controlled; Part 2 (12–28 weeks)
re-randomized placebo patients to TIL; Part 3 (28–64 weeks,
reSURFACE 1; 28–52 weeks, reSURFACE 2) re-randomized patients
with ≥PASI 50 to continue or increase TIL dose or to placebo
based on their PASI response at week 28. In this post-hoc pooled
analysis, patients consistently on TIL 100 mg and 200 mg from
baseline to week 52 were classified in 5 mutually exclusive groups
based on their week-28 PASI response: PASI < 50, PASI 50–74,
PASI 75–89, PASI 90–99, and PASI 100. Baseline characteristics
and % PASI improvement from baseline up to week 52 (observed
data) were examined for each group.
Results: This analysis included 575 (TIL 100 mg) and 581 (TIL
200 mg) patients; the proportions of patients with week-28 PASI
75/90/100 responses were 77%/54%/23% (TIL 100 mg) and
78%/58%/29% (TIL 200 mg). At week 28, 133 (23.1%), 175
(30.4%), 137 (23.8%), 82 (14.3%), and 48 (8.3%) TIL 100 mg
patients and 170 (29.3%), 169 (29.1%), 114 (19.6%), 105 (18.1%),
and 23 (4.0%) TIL 200mg achieved PASI 100, PASI 90–99, PASI
75–89, PASI 50–74, and PASI < 50, respectively. On average,
PASI 100 patients were younger, lighter, and had shorter disease
duration at baseline compared to other response groups. For TIL
100 mg, % PASI improvement was highest for PASI 100 and least
for PASI < 50 patients on all visits up to week 28 (week 4: 53%,
46%, 38%, 30%, and 16%; week 28: 100%, 95%, 83%, 64%, and
33% for PASI 100, PASI 90–99, PASI 75–89, PASI 50–74, and
PASI < 50 categories, respectively). Among patients achieving
PASI > 50 at week 28 and continued up to 52 weeks, % PASI
improvement maintained or improved from week 28 to week 52.
Similar results were observed for TIL 200 mg as well as a subgroup
analysis with bio-naive and bio-experienced patients respectively.
Conclusions: The majority of TIL 100 and 200 mg patients achieved
PASI > 50 response at week 28, and PASI improvement was
maintained from week 28 to week 52. Among patients achieving
PASI > 90 at week 28, TIL 100 and 200 mg were associated with
a rapid PASI improvement by week 4.

POTENTIAL DISCONNECT: CO-MANAGEMENT OF
PATIENTS WITH PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS BETWEEN
RHEUMATOLOGISTS AND DERMATOLOGISTS
Lynn Price, Jennifer Robinson, Gianna Melendez
Spherix Global Insights
Introduction: On average, the majority of psoriasis (PSO) patients
are diagnosed a year prior to a psoriatic arthritis (PsA) diagnosis,
making the referral patterns and co-management between derma50
www.medicaljournals.se/acta
5th World Psoriasis & Psoriatic Arthritis Conference 2018
tologists and rheumatologists an important aspect to understanding
the management of these diseases. Dermatologists represent an
important referral-base for rheumatologists, accounting for over
one-quarter of all new PsA patients. However, there are discrepancies
between the specialists regarding the timing in which these
referrals take place.
Objectives: One objective of the study was to gain further insight
into rheumatologist and dermatologist co-management of patients
with PsA.
Methods: An independent market analytics firm collaborated with
US rheumatologists (n = 101) and US dermatologists (n = 101) to
conduct analysis of both the PsA and PSO markets. Data were
collected via an online survey fielded in November/December
2017 and included patient demographics, as well as physician
demographics, and attitudinal survey responses.
Results: Rheumatologists indicate that 51 percent of referrals result
from primary care physicians, 28 percent result from a dermatologist,
and 13 percent are self-referred. The majority (73%) of
PsA patients under the care of collaborating rheumatologists had
previously been diagnosed with PSO prior to PsA. Dermatologists
state that one-quarter of their patients with severe PSO also have
PsA, with more than one-third of severe PSO patients also being
co-managed with a rheumatologist. The majority of rheumatologists
believe that dermatologists refer patients at the first sign of
joint involvement and do not attempt to treat joint pain; however,
31 percent of dermatologists report they do not refer PSO patients
to rheumatologists until patients have failed biologics or are not
improving on their current systemic regimen, while an additional
35 percent report they refer only severe arthritis/patients with
worsening disease. Furthermore, only 35 percent of dermatologists
agree that they refer their PSO patients to a rheumatologists at the
first sign of joint involvement.
At the time of dermatologist referral, rheumatologists state that
two-thirds of referred patients are biologic/apremilast naïve, with
only 6 percent having controlled PSO and joint pain. However,
dermatologists state that 40 percent the patients that they referred
to rheumatologists were treated with biologics and 15 percent of
said referred patients were treated with apremilast. Indeed, 76
percent of dermatologists agree with the statement, “I believe that
starting my PSO patients earlier on biologic therapy will slow
the development and progression of the arthritic component of
the disease (PsA),” while 57 percent of dermatologists agree “I
prefer to use biologics that are indicated in both PSO and PsA.”
Conclusion: With many patients diagnosed with both PSO and
PsA, co-management between dermatologists and rheumatologists
is common. While rheumatologists appear to be under the
impression that they are receiving the majority of dermatologisttreated
patients with PsA at the first sign of joint involvement,
dermatologists largely report that they are managing and treating
PsA patients. Furthermore, most dermatologists believe early aggressive
use of biologic treatments will mitigate the development
and/or progression of joint involvement, implying their willingness
to manage their patients with PsA, particularly at early stages.

THE USE OF TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR INHIBITORS
(TNF) IN THE SECOND-LINE BIOLOGIC/SMALL
MOLECULE SETTING: A CROSS-SPECIALTY
COMPARISON
Lynn Price, Jennifer Robinson, Gianna Melendez
Spherix Global Insights
TNF therapy has been the standard of care for adult patients
diagnosed with autoimmune conditions, resulting in familiarity,
comfort, and satisfaction among physicians. TNFs are typically
used as a first-line biologic/small molecule in the treatment of
psoriasis (PSO) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). However, the adoption
of agents with alternate mechanisms of action (AMOA) has
increased in recent years across indications and the practice of
sequential TNF prescribing after an initial TNF is less common.
Though TNFs are still the preferred first-line agent, there are discrepancies
between specialists on the use of AMOA agents in the
second-line setting. This research sought to understand the extent
to which AMOA agents are prescribed after an initial TNF, and
how this varies across PSO and PsA.
An independent market analytics firm collaborated with US dermatologists
(n = 201) and US rheumatologists (n = 200) to conduct
a retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with PSO
(n = 950) and PsA (n = 1,008) who had switched from one biologic/
apremilast to another agent in the prior 12 weeks. Physicians were
able to submit up to 7 patient charts. PSO data was collected in
September 2017 and PsA data was collected in April 2017.
Analysis of patients recently switched from one biologic/apremilast
to a different brand revealed the majority of patients were
treated with a TNF in the first-line biologic/small molecule setting,
though this varies by indication. Rheumatologists prescribe
first-line TNFs significantly more than dermatologists. 83% of
PsA patients are prescribed TNFs first-line compared to just 69%
of PSO patients. Furthermore, rheumatologists are significantly
more likely to practice TNF-sequencing than dermatologists.
Indeed, 44% of PsA patients treated with a first-line TNF were
prescribed a second TNF, compared to 6% of PSO patients. Additionally,
certain TNF brands have experienced recent declines
in first line use, though this varies by indication as well. For rheumatologists,
use of first-line etanercept has declined, 38% of PsA
patients were initiated on etanercept at least 24 months prior to
the study, compared to just 28% initiated on etanercept within 12
months of the study. For dermatologists, there were significantly
more PSO patients initiated on etanercept in the first-line setting
24 months or more prior to the study compared to those initiated
within 12 months of the study, (45% vs 31%.) This pattern also
held true for adalimumab, where 42% of first-line PSO patients
initiated more than 24 months prior to the study were prescribed
adalimumab, a figure that drops to just 27% for patients initiated
within 12 months.
Though the position of TNFs as first-line agents remains dominant,
the treating specialist and indication influence how widespread and
continuous TNF use is. Specifically, dermatologists are less likely
to prescribe TNFs as first-line agents and are also significantly
less likely to partake in the sequencing of TNFs in the first- and
second-line setting than rheumatologists. The introduction of
several agents in PSO reporting substantially higher rates of skin
clearance compared to TNFs could potentially be the source of
increased switching to AMOAs compared to other specialties;
whereas superior efficacy of AMOA agents over TNFs in PsA
may be less apparent.

(GUS) with placebo (PBO) and adalimumab (ADA) in patients
(pts) with moderate-to-severe PsO. The impact of treatment on
patient-reported outcomes (PROs) was evaluated.
Methods: Pts were randomized to GUS 100mg (wks 0 & 4, then

or PBO (wks 0, 4, & 12, then GUS 100 mg wks 16 & 20). We
evaluated PROs using the Work Limitations Questionnaire [WLQ;
work productivity], the Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale
[HADS], and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form
(SF-36; health related quality of life) at wk16 (GUS vs PBO) and
wk24 (GUS vs ADA) in pts with and without PsA.
Results: In all, 18% of pts reported a history of PsA. At wk16,
GUS pts had numerically greater improvements vs PBO in work
productivity, anxiety and depression, and SF-36 PCS & MCS
scores regardless of PsA status. The least square (LS) mean differences
(95% CI; adjusted for baseline value) for GUS vs PBO
for all PROs were generally similar between pts with and without
PsA. At wk24, GUS pts had numerically greater improvements
vs ADA in all PROs regardless of PsA status. The LS mean differences
for GUS vs ADA were generally greater for pts with PsA
vs pts without PsA (Table).
Conclusions: GUS showed better improvements in all PROs vs
PBO at wk16 and vs ADA at wk24. Improvements vs PBO were
similar regardless of PsA status, while improvements vs ADA
were greater for pts with PsA.

THE DERMATOLOGY LIFE QUALITY INDEX IN
RUSSIAN PATIENTS WITH PSORIASIS AND PSORIATIC
ARTHRITIS.
Nadezhda Batkaeva, Edgem Batkaev, Muslimat Gitinova
Peoples' Friendship University of Russia (RUDN University)
Introduction: The most severe form of psoriasis is psoriatic arthritis
(PsA), which belongs to the seronegative spondyloarthritis group,
characterized by chronic inflammation of the joints, spine, enthesis.
The frequency of PsA in the population is 0.06–1.4%. PSA is
comparable to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in terms of progression,
disability and quality of life (QOL) in patients.
Objectives: Compare the quality of life index of patients with
severe forms of psoriasis (PsO) with psoriatic arthritis patients’
index.
Methods: 120 (100%) patients suffering from PsO and PsA
(Male-87/female - 33) were analyzed. 70 (54.2%) patients were
diagnosed PsO, 50 (41.7%) were diagnosed PsA. The average
age of patients with skin manifestations PsO was 54.0±14.2 years
(n = 70). The average age of patients with PsA was 49.1±15.9 years
(n = 50). The group of patients with PsA was older than the group
PsO patients by age. PASI > 10. The quality of life was assessed
using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire.
The results were evaluated: from 0 to 1 score - cutaneous disease
does not affect the patient's life, from 2 to 5 scores - the disease
has a minor effect on the patient's life, from 6 to 10 scores - the
disease has a moderate effect on the patient's life, from 11 to 20
scores - the disease has a very strong effect on the patient's life,
from 21 to 30 scores - the disease has an extremely strong effect
on the patient's life. Statistical processing of the data was carried
out using the Excel analysis package. All p < 0.05 were considered
to indicate statistical significance.
Results: 120 (100%) patients suffering from PsO were taken for
analysis. The duration of PsO was: for more than 15 years - 25
people (35.7%), 10–15 years - 18 people (25.7%); 3–10 years -
15 people (21.4%), 1–3 years - 12 people (17.1%). The duration
of PsA was: for more than 15 years – 5 people (10.0%), 10–15
years – 7 people (14.0%); 3–10 years – 20 people (40.0%), 1–3
years – 18 people (36.0%). Heredity was aggravated in 35 (29.1%)
out of 120 patients. Comorbidity was presented in 112 (93.3%) out
of 120 patients. Gastrointestinal and liver diseases were found in
48 (42.8%) out of 120 patients. Type 2 diabetes was observed in
45 (40.1%) out of 120 patients, cardiovascular diseases - in 100
(89.2%) out of 120 patients, diseases of the nervous system - in 59
(52.6%) out of 120 patients, and diseases of the urinary system - in
20 (17.8%) out of 120 patients.
The total score DLQI in the psoriasis group was 15.8±5.2. The
score DLQI in PsO patients was 12.5±3.4 and in PsA patients was
20.4±3.7. The total score DLQI in PsO patients with comorbidity
was 16.1±5.3.
Conclusions: The total score DLQI was significantly higher in
patients with PsA compare to PsO patients. This result revealed
the existence of an inferior quality of life for the PsO patients with
comorbidity disease, compared with pts without comorbidity disease.
The score of DLQI is affected the development and progress
of the psoriasis and comorbidity pathology. Then higher DLQI
value, the more it affects experience considerable physical and/
or psychological discomfort, difficulties in social and professional
adaptation, which subsequently cause significant distress and even
social phobia. All these conditions psoriasis are interrelated by
genetic and immunopathogenetic mechanisms. Thus, patients with
psoriasis require an integrated approach and dynamic observation
by dermatologists and doctors of related specialties.

EFFECTS OF MINDFULNESS-BASED COGNITIVE
THERAPY ON SELF-REPORTED PSORIASIS AND
PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS
Alan Maddock, David Hevey
School of Psychology, Trinity College Dublin
Introduction: Psoriasis can have a profound impact on a patient’s
life, with the prevalence of anxiety, depression, poor wellbeing
and quality of life generally found to be high in psoriasis populations.
Mindfulness based interventions have been shown to have
positive impacts on anxiety, depression, wellbeing and quality of
life in various populations.
Objectives: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect
of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) on psoriasis
symptoms and psychological symptoms associated with psoriasis
including anxiety, depression, reduced wellbeing and QoL. The
study also aimed to investigate if MBCT significantly impacted
the potential mediating variables of a new theory of mindfulness
mechanisms the ‘Clinically Modified Buddhist Psychological
Model (CBPM)’, these variables being acceptance, mindfulness,
self-compassion, aversion, non-attachment, attention, rumination
and worry.

Methods: 101 participants were randomly allocated to a treatment
arm (MBCT) or a TAU arm. Participants were measured pre, posttreatment
and after a 3-month follow up period. Data were analysed
using intention-to-treat analysis and the ANCOVA method with
baseline scores entered as covariates.
Results: There was a significant group×time (pre vs. post) interaction
on all variables except QoL, indicating a significant reduction
of each variable except QoL over time in the MBCT group, but not
in the control group. When baseline variables were controlled for,
the participants in the MBCT group achieved small statistically
significant changes across all variables post intervention versus
the TAU group.
Conclusions: The results suggest that MBCT may be a useful adjunct
therapy for those suffering from psoriasis and the associated
psychological symptoms relating to the condition. The results
also indicate that each of the mechanisms outlined in the CBPM
change significantly for patients who engage in the intervention.

A MIXED METHODS STUDY EXPLORING THE
IMPACT OF MINDFULNESS ON PSORIASIS, ANXIETY,
DEPRESSION AND QOL
Alan Maddock, David Hevey
School of Psychology, Trinity College Dublin
Introduction: Psoriasis is a common condition with recognised
psychological comorbidity. Psoriasis can have a profound impact
on a patient’s life, with the prevalence of anxiety, depression, poor
wellbeing and quality of life generally found to be high in psoriasis
populations. Based on Buddhist psychology, mindfulness based
interventions have been shown to have positive impacts on anxiety,
depression, wellbeing and quality of life in various populations.
Methods: Mixed methods explored the impact of a mindfulness
based cognitive therapy (MBCT) intervention on 10 psoriasis
patients using a Buddhist Psychological Model (BPM) as a
theoretical framework to understand changes in these variables.
Quantitative measures of acceptance, attention regulation, attachment,
aversion, self-compassion, mindfulness, rumination,
worry, wellbeing, anxiety, depression and psoriasis symptoms
were completed pre and post intervention, and participants were
interviewed about their experiences of MBCT.
Results: Statistically significant changes in attention, mindfulness,
attachment, aversion, rumination, quality of life, anxiety and
psoriasis were found. The qualitative data provided support for
the BPM as a theoretical lens with which to understand the way
in which mindfulness impacts on patient quality of life, anxiety
and psoriasis symptoms.
Conclusions: This study gives support to the promising potential
of mindfulness interventions being implemented by mental health
care professionals with psoriasis patients.

Introduction: Patient(pt)-physician(HCP) communication may
influence symptom reporting and disease control.
Objectives: To evaluate psoriatic arthritis (PsA) symptoms, life
impact and treatment satisfaction in pts who report good communication
with their HCP vs suboptimal communication.
Methods: An online pt-based survey was conducted in the US
from 2 Nov–1 Dec 2017. Pts had reported having PsA for > 1
year, taken ≥1 synthetic(s) or biologic(b) DMARD for PsA. Pts
reported overall health, PsA severity/symptoms/life impact, treatment
satisfaction and communication experience. We evaluated
differences by pt-HCP communication status.
Results: Overall, 301 pts with PsA responded, mean age 45 years,
61% female, 89% self-reported moderate/severe PsA. Current PsA
treatments included bDMARD (52%), sDMARD (25%), combination
b/sDMARD (15%). Overall, 256 (85%) of PsA pts were
managed by a rheumatologist and 15% by a dermatologist. Of the
256, > 40% reported suboptimal pt-HCP communication. Pts in
the suboptimal vs good communication subgroups were typically
younger, more likely to be Hispanic and reported greater life impact
and lower satisfaction with pt-HCP communication (Table).

PSORIASIS PATIENTS POINT OF VIEW: WHAT ARE WE
MISSING WHEN MANAGING THEM?

Introduction: Psoriasis is a skin disease that can occur at any
time and it is most common in the age group 50–69. The reported
prevalence of Psoriasis in countries ranges between 0.09% and
11.4%, making it a serious global problem.
Psoriasis affects the quality of life and it is associated with many
comorbidities such as depression, diabetes, cardiovascular disease
and psoriatic arthritis.
To evaluate the severity and the efficiency of the treatment applied
to patients with Psoriasis, in practice it is used PASI (Psoriasis
Area and Severity Index). The value may vary, for example, in this
study, PASI 75 represents the percentage (or number) of patients
that have achieved a 75% or more reduction in their PASI score
in 12 weeks from baseline.
Objectives: Aim of this study is to gain a better perspective on
the Psoriasis patient’s point of view when seeking a physician’s
Poster abstracts 53

help, therefore, to try and minimize the gaps that exist when
managing them.
Methods: This study was based on a custom questionnaire which
included 14 questions for each patient. The responses were
gathered from 20 patients (and it is still ongoing) diagnosed in
our Department of Dermatology and Venereology Timisoara, each
in different stages of disease. All the answers are confidential
and anonymous. An informed consent was signed prior to any
taken actions. To achieve meaningful results, we asked patients
to be honest and to present the situation in a real way. The most
important question on the questionnaire was “Which of the three
options represents the PASI score you would like to achieve?
50/75/90?”. In addition to this question, we provided the patients
with three pictures each of them showing a different PASI score,
so they can choose the proper answer much easier.
Results: 80% of the patients chose PASI 90, 15% chose PASI 75
and only 5% chose PASI 50.
In addition to this, the gender distribution showed us that 100%
of the female patients chose PASI 90, proving how important
appearance is for them, and how much of a weight it is for them
to have disease that is in the limelight. On the other hand, the
male patients were divided into three groups. 69% said that the
efficiency of the therapy is very good, choosing PASI 90. Only
23% of male patients consider PASI 75 satisfying and the last 8%
represents PASI 50.
Conclusions: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease, which
is intensively studied at the cellular and molecular level. What is
considered a good response to a treatment is sometimes different
from the perception of a patient vs. a physician, therefore we must
always keep a balance between aiming high (and maybe risking to
over-treat some patients) and meeting the patient’s expectations.

Introduction: Patients’ perspectives on the effects of psoriasis
(PsO) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) on health-related quality of
life (HRQoL) are important in establishing better approaches to
their care and treatment.
Objectives: To better understand the impact of PsO and PsA on
daily life, education and work in Scandinavian countries.
Methods: The NORdic PAtient survey of PsOriasis and Psoriatic
arthritis (NORPAPP) was an on-line survey carried out in Nov/
Dec 2015 using YouGov panels in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway.
Adults (18–74 years old), with physician-diagnosed PsO or PsA
(n = 1221), answered questions about the impact of disease on 10
aspects of daily activity/mood and on work/education; 5-point
Likert scale responses were dichotomised into “no/minor impact”
(1–3 or “don’t know”) and “strong impact” (4–5).
Results: For the 10 aspects of activity/mood a “strong impact” was
reported for ≥4, 1–3 or 0 aspects by 22.8%, 24.2%, and 61.9% of
respondents with PsO alone and 44.5%, 63.0%, and 27.0% of those
with PsA±PsO. The most commonly reported strong impacts were
limitations on dress (22.6%), sleep disorders (16.3%) and depression
and/or anxiety (16.2%) for respondents with PsO alone; and,
daily routine (45.1%), leisure/sports (44.0%), sleeping disorders
(44.5%), and limitations on clothing (41.8%) for respondents
with PsA±PsO. Regarding the impacts on work/career or education
since development of symptoms, 6.4% of respondents with
PsO alone and 30.3% of those with PsA±PsO reported a strong
negative impact. Of the 82.2% of respondents who were working
or studying, frequency of absences in the previous 12 months
were significantly higher (Bonferroni corrected z-tests, total α =
0.05) among those who: had PsA±PsO vs PsO alone; perceived
their symptoms to be severe vs non-severe; used systemic vs
only topical treatments; were aged 18–44 years vs 45–74; were
members of patient groups vs non-members; saw a dermatologist
or rheumatologist at least annually vs those who did not.
Conclusion: PsO has a profound impact on the HRQoL and career/
education of individuals with these conditions in Scandinavia. The
impact is greater among individuals with PsA±PsO.

University of Khartoum- faculty of medicine
Introduction: Psoriasis is a common chronic non-contagious skin
disease, affecting 1–3% of the world population. Defects in the
immune regulation and the control of inflammation are thought
to play major roles. Quality of life (QOL) is increasingly recognized
as an important outcome measure in dermatology. Psoriasis
although it doesn’t affect the survival it has a great impact on quality
of life of patients, and has a strong effect on social relations,
psychological status, daily activities and thought to be associated
with depression.
Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of
psoriasis on the quality of life(QOL) of the patients in Khartoum
dermatology hospital, 2017.
Methods: Descriptive case series study, hospital based survey
conducted among 70 participants from psoriasis patients aged
above 18 years in Khartoum dermatology hospital, through selfadministered
standard questionnaire, which was developed after
extensive literature reviewing, comprised of Socio-demographic
data, psoriasis life stress inventory(PLSI), psoriasis disability
index(PDI) and depression assessment.
Results: 64.3% of the participants have a high psoriasis-related
stress (PLSI) and 35.7% have a low psoriasis-related stress. 21.4%
of the participants have a very large disability in daily activities
(PDI), 37.1% have a large disability, 24.3% have a moderate disability,
14.3% have a mild disability and 2.9% have no disability at
all.7.1% of the participants have a moderately severe depression,
15.7% have a moderate depression, 35.7% have a mild depression,
41.4% have none or minimal depression and none of the
participants has a severe depression.
Conclusion: the study concluded that psoriasis has impacts on
the quality of life, causing high stress and high disability in daily
activities with variable degrees of depression.
Key words: psoriasis, QOL, PLSI, PDI, depression.

Introduction: In a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial
(NCT02899988), mirikizumab met its primary efficacy endpoint
at Week 16.1
Objective:To determine if mirikizumab improves patient-reported
disease severity and general health status in psoriasis patients at
Week 16.
Methods: Adults with moderate-to-severe psoriasis were randomized
1:1:1:1 to receive placebo (n = 52), mirikizumab 30 mg
(n = 51), 100 mg (n = 51), or 300 mg (n = 51) at Weeks 0 and 8.
At baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16, patients completed the
Patient Global Assessment of psoriasis (PtGA) (0 = clear, 5 = severe).
At baseline and Week 16, patients completed the Medical
Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36;
[range 0–100]) which measures 8 general health status domains
that can be scored as mental component and physical component
summaries. For continuous measures, comparisons were made
by a mixed-effects for repeated measures model (PtGA) or an
analysis of covariance model (SF-36). Comparisons of categorical
efficacy variables were conducted by logistic regression analysis
with non-responder imputation (NRI).
Results: At Week 16, mirikizumab-treated patients reported greater
improvements in psoriasis severity and aspects of physical functioning
versus placebo (Table).
Conclusion: Mirikizumab treatment at various doses significantly
improved psoriatic disease severity and physical health status.

Introduction: The negative impact of psoriasis extends beyond
the patient, affecting his/her social interactions and the quality
of life of cohabitants. Furthermore, patients with psoriasis often
experience sexual difficulties because of their disease.
Objective:This analysis examined the effect of treatment with
tildrakizumab (TIL) on personal relationships of patients with
moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.
Methods: Patients in two phase 3 trials reSURFACE 1
(NCT01722331) and reSURFACE 2 (NCT01729754) were
randomized to subcutaneous TIL 200 mg, 100 mg, or placebo
(PBO) and received treatment at weeks 0 and 4. PBO patients
were re-randomized at week 12 to either TIL 200 mg or 100 mg.
Etanercept (ETN) 50 mg (semiweekly until week 12 then weekly
until week 28) was also a treatment arm in reSURFACE 2. Data on
personal relationships were collected at weeks 12 and 28 from the
Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire question
8 (Q8) “Over the last week, how much has your skin created problems
with your partner or any of your close friends or relatives”
and question 9 (Q9) “Over the last week, how much has your skin
caused any sexual difficulties”. Each question was scored on a
scale of 0 (not affected at all) to 3 (very much affected). The data
were pooled from reSURFACE 1 and 2.
Results: In all, 1,820 patients had DLQI data. All patients reported
a negative effect for Q8 and Q9 at baseline. At week 12, the
proportion of patients with no negative effect (score of 0) on personal
relationships (Q8 and Q9) was higher for TIL 200 mg, TIL
100 mg, and ETN than for PBO (76%, 72%, and 64% vs. 39%,
respectively). A similar trend was observed for individual questions
Q8 and Q9. At week 28, more patients on TIL 200 mg and TIL
100 mg reported no negative effect on personal relationships than
those on ETN (85% and 77% vs. 66%; respectively). More patients
on TIL 200 mg and TIL 100 mg reported no negative effect than
those on ETN for Q8 (89% and 81% vs. 70%; respectively) and
for Q9 (89% and 84% vs. 75%, respectively).
Conclusions: TIL had a beneficial effect on psoriasis-related
personal relationship problems and sexual difficulties, compared
to placebo and ETN.

Introduction: Chronic pruritus lasts for at least 6 weeks and is a
most common symptom in patients with psoriasis. Pruritus is a
highly prevalent and troublesome symptom and has a negative
impact upon patients’ health-related quality of life (QoL). The
ItchyQoL is a pruritus-specific QoL questionnaire that can be applied
to patients with pruritus independent of the underlying disease.
Objective:To assess the impact of pruritus on QoL in patients with
psoriasis by an exploratory analysis of baseline characteristics of
subjects from the PSORITUS study.
Methods: PSORITUS was an exploratory, randomized, doubleblind,
placebo-controlled 16-week drug withdrawal study with a
16-week open-label run-in phase, to assess the kinetics of psoriasis
symptoms, pruritus intensity, and lesional biomarkers. Subjects

a 100-point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS, the worst itching within
a recall period of 24 hours), were included. In an exploratory baseline
analysis, correlation coefficients were calculated between
ItchyQoL outputs and individual baseline characteristics based
on Spearman‘s (r) and Kendall rank correlations (t). A multiple
linear regression model was performed to assess the effect of
exploratory variables correlating with the ItchyQoL score and
achieving statistical significance (p-value < 0.05).
Results: The study included 130 subjects with psoriasis. The
subjects had a mean age of 46.8 years (standard deviation [SD],
12.30) and majority (71.5%) were in the age group of 35–64 years.
The mean (SD) time since first diagnosis of psoriasis and psoriatic
arthritis (PsA) was 19.5 (13.81) and 17.2 (18.30) years, respectively;
13.8% of subjects had PsA. The mean (SD) baseline PASI, patient
benefit index (PBI), and ItchyQoL score was 23.9 (10.85), 84.2
(24.17), and 78.7 (17.42) respectively, indicating severe disease
activity and pruritus. The baseline ItchyQoL score showed moderate
correlation with baseline VAS scores for average and worst pruritus
(r: 0.542 [95% CI: 0.41, 0.65] and 0.547 [95% CI: 0.41, 0.66]; t:
0.381 [95% CI: 0.22, 0.52] and 0.383, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.52]) and
a strong correlation with baseline dermatology life quality index
(DLQI) scores (r: 0.803 [95% CI: 0.73, 0.86]; t: 0.622 [95% CI:
0.50, 0.72]. Furthermore the multiple linear regression analysis
showed substantial dependency of QoL measured by ItchyQoL
for VAS (average pruritus last 24 h), duration of psoriasis and
health-related patient needs as measured by patient benefit index.
Conclusions: ItchyQoL assessment demonstrated that subjects
with psoriasis are highly burdened by pruritus and show severely
impaired quality of life. The correlation between pruritus intensity,
ItchyQoL- and DLQI questionnaire results suggests the need for
routine assessment of pruritus in clinical practice.

Introduction: Psoriasis is a common, long-term skin disease that
affects approximately 1.5–3% of the population. The burden of
living with psoriasis is equivalent to or greater than that seen in
other long-term conditions, such as cardiac failure and chronic
lung disease. The stigma provoked by the disease, often lead
to the discontinuation of daily activities and social withdrawal.
Nevertheless, these effects of psoriasis are seldom recognized and
often undertreated.
Objectives: The aim of the study is to evaluate the quality of life,
anxiety and depression, self-esteem and loneliness in patients
with psoriasis.
Methods: Ninety-eight patients with psoriasis were enrolled in the
study. The quality of life, depression and anxiety, loneliness and
self-esteem of the patient were assessed using the Dermatology
Life Quality Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the
UCLA loneliness Scale (UCLA-Version 3) and Rosenberg’s Selfesteem
Scale, respectively.
Results: The Dermatology Quality of Life Index score among psoriasis
patients was 13.52±4.58. They had statistically significantly
higher scores according to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale -anxiety subscale (p = 0.031)-compared with healthy volunteers.
Moreover, a statistically significant difference was found
between the two groups concerning the UCLA-scale (p = 0.032)
and RSES-scale (p < 0.0001). Female patients presented with lower
self-esteem than male patients.

SWEDISH PSORIATIC PATIENTS’ PERSPECTIVE OF
THEIR DISEASE. RESULTS FROM AN OBSERVATIONAL
PATIENT SURVEY
Charlotta Enerbäck1, Sofie Fors2, Anna-Karin Dahlborn2

Sweden, 2Novartis
Introduction: A global patient survey was adapted and implemented
in Sweden, in order to explore and understand the patients’ view
on their disease, as well as the personal and emotional impact of
their psoriasis. The focus of the survey was the patient’s perception
of the possibility to achieve clear skin, and how having clear skin
could affect their quality of life. A publication based on earlier
data is under review.
Methods: The Swedish “Clear about Psoriasis” survey was conducted
from June 16 2017 to August 8 2017. Recruitment was made
via online panels and patient organizations. Validated methods
were used to assess severity of disease and health-related quality
of life. The survey consisted of multiple-choice questions, no
definition of clear skin was given, and spontaneous feelings/perceptions
were reported. Respondents (≥18 years old) were required
to have current plaque psoriasis, for which they had received a
medical diagnosis and should not have participated in an online
survey about psoriasis in the preceding four weeks. The analysis
included only patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis,
defined as a Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score ≥10, or
a PASI score 5.0–9.9 with plaques in visible and/or in sensitive
areas, such as the face and genitals.
Results: In total, 54 patient responses were completed and analyzed.
Mean age was 45 years and 80% were female. The average
self-assessed PASI score was 16.0, 26% had PASI 5.0–9.9, 74%
PASI > 10 and 54% reported to have psoriatic arthritis. Current
treatment allowed 44% of patients to achieve clear or almost clear
skin. Clear or almost clear skin was believed to be achievable by
30% of the patients. Of patients reaching clear or almost clear
skin, 71% had talked to their physician about their aim for clear
skin. Among patients who have not achieved clear or almost clear
skin, 47% had spoken to their physician about their aim. 57% of
the patients were satisfied with their current treatment. The most
important reasons for treatment satisfaction were less itching (81%),
and the achievement of less pain and soreness (55%). Not achieving
clear skin was the major reason for dissatisfaction. Discrimination
or humiliation has been experienced by 98%. About 69% have
been asked if they are contagious. Relationships were affected and
52% avoided to have sex. Worklife was affected by 65% of the
respondents. For 58% of patients it took more than 5 years to get
a treatment that resulted in clear or almost clear skin. During the
last 6 months, 24% of employed patients had taken at least one day
off work due to their disease whilst 5% took more than 14 days.
Conclusions: This survey shows that a majority of patients do not
believe achieving clear or almost clear skin is possible and they
are not comfortable to talk to their physician about it. Furthermore,
patients encounter a stigmatizing environment. Better treatment
as well as improved patient information is needed.
Novartis is grateful to Psoriasisförbundet for facilitating the survey.

Introduction: Ixekizumab, a high-affinity monoclonal antibody
that selectively targets IL-17A, was shown to be superior to ustekinumab,
an IL-12/23 inhibitor, with respect to skin clearance and
quality of life up to 24 wks in patients with moderate-to-severe
psoriasis in IXORA-S1.
Objectives: The objective of this analysis was to compare the
cumulative benefits of ixekizumab versus ustekinumab at 12 and
24 weeks of treatment in IXORA-S, with respect to skin clearance,
itching, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and pain.
Methods: In the IXORA-S trial, patients were randomized (1:1)
to receive either IXE (160-mg starting dose, then 80-mg every 2
wks for 12 wks followed by 80-mg every 4 wks; n = 136) or UST
(45–mg/90-mg weight-based dosing per label; n = 166) through
52 wks. Data at week 12 and week 24 were used in this post-hoc
analysis. At wks 2, 4, and every 4 wks thereafter, clinical benefits
were measured using percentage improvements in Psoriasis Area
and Severity Index (PASI 75/90/100); the Itch Numeric Rating
Scale (NRS; 0 = no itch, 10 = worst itch imaginable); and Skin Pain
VAS (0 = no pain, 100 = maximum pain). Health-related quality
of life (HRQoL) benefit was measured at wks 2, 4, 12, and 24
using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) [DLQI score =
0.1 indicates no effect on patient’s life]. Total benefits - PASI
75/90/100; itch NRS = 0; DLQI = 0.1; Pain VAS 0 – were used to
determine the area-under-the-curve (AUC) of responders for each
outcome at 12 and 24 weeks. Missing values were imputed using
non-responder imputation (NRI). AUC results, capturing the rapid
and sustained treatment response, were normalized as a percentage
of maximum possible (0–100%) AUC. The clinical benefit ratios
between IXE vs UST were calculated for each outcome to show
relative cumulative benefit.
Results: At 12 wks, the normalized cumulative clinical benefit
with IXE vs UST, respectively, was 58.2% and 32.9% (PASI75);
36.7% and 15.6% (PASI90); 14.2% and 4.0% (PASI100); 25.3%
and 14.3% (itch); 36.0% and 23.7% (pain); and 44.9% and 25.2%
(DLQI). Cumulative clinical benefits at week 24 for IXE and UST,
respectively, were 74.3% and 54.3% (PASI75), 58.1% and 32.3%
(PASI90), 29.0% and 12.2% (PASI100); 33.5% and 22.1% (itch);
42.7% and 30.6% (pain); and 54.3% and 37.0% (DLQI). At 12 wks,
clinical benefit ratios (IXE/UST) for PASI 75/90/100 were 1.77,
2.36, and 3.52; 1.51 for pain; and 1.78 for both itch and DLQI. At
24 wks, the ratios were 1.37, 1.80, 2.38 (PASI 75/90/100), 1.52
(itch), 1.39 (pain) and 1.47 (DLQI).
Conclusions: Cumulative benefits measured by PASI, itch, pain,
and DLQI responders were greater for IXE vs. UST following 12
and 24 wks of treatment. Long-term cumulative benefits will be
addressed upon publication of Week 52 results from the IXORA-S
trial.

Introduction: Coach@home (c@h) is a German support program
for certolizumab pegol (CZP)-treated patients (pts) with rheumatic
diseases, including psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Eight coaching calls
are offered over one year, scheduled around critical milestones on
the therapeutic journey. These are made by trained nurses, who
offer support and information about both the pt’s disease and its
treatment with CZP.
Objectives: To assess the baseline characteristics of PsA pts subscribed
to c@h, and the level of pt satisfaction with the program
across indications (Sep 2017 data cut).
Methods: c@h was launched in Jun 2014, and is available to pts
who are prescribed CZP according to the local product label. Pts
must be CZP-naïve when subscribed to the program, and pt consent
is required prior to subscription by the treating physician. There
are no additional criteria for enrolment, although the program must
be recommended to the pt by the treating physician. Pt satisfaction
across indications (PsA, rheumatoid arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis)
was measured at program completion or discontinuation
using the net promoter score (NPS), which has previously been
used for this purpose.1 The NPS is derived by asking pts to state
the likelihood that they would recommend c@h to others (on a
0–10 scale). Rankings of 9–10 are considered ‘promoters’, 7–8
‘passives’, and 0–6 ‘detractors’. Subtracting the percentage of
detractors from that of promoters yields the NPS.
Results: A cumulative total of 136 PsA pts had been registered to
c@h by Sep 2017. Mean age at baseline was 52 years; the majority
were female (69%). Prior biological DMARD exposure was 24%.
The most common topics discussed on calls were treatment adherence
(290 calls), CZP maintenance dose (284 calls) and syringe
disposal (201 calls). The average length per call was 15.7 min
(SD: 5.33) at the end of Week 0 (total: 135 calls), and 14.6 min
(SD: 6.59) at the end of Week 52 (45 calls).
Across indications, a cumulative total of 272/655 pts had either
completed the coaching period (n = 70) or discontinued (n = 202)
by 28 Sep 2017, of whom 106 rated the program. Of these, 87.5%
gave promoter scores, 10.4% passive, and 3.8% detractor, yielding
an NPS of 83.7. The program was still ongoing at the time
of this data cut.
Conclusions: c@h offers support and guidance to CZP-treated pts
in Germany. Feedback from pts willing to provide a rating (39%)
indicates a high level of satisfaction with the program.

A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY ASSESSING THE FAMILY
PLANNING NEEDS OF WOMEN WITH PSORIASIS

Introduction: Psoriasis (PS) in women often overlaps with their
peak reproductive years. Data on the family planning (FP) experience
of patients (pts) are therefore needed to optimize PS
management.
Objectives: To report the results of a survey evaluating the FP
needs of women with PS.
Methods: Women of childbearing potential (WoCP; aged 18–45)
diagnosed with PS (including pts with psoriatic arthritis), were
recruited to complete a 96-question web-based survey on SurveyGizmo
®. The survey included questions on pts’ experience,
concerns and educational needs, and was disseminated using eblasts
(the National Psoriasis Foundation, Advance E-News, and
TalkPsoriasis.org mailing lists) and social media (Facebook and
Twitter). Responses were collected Dec 2017–Feb 2018.
Results: Of 141 pts completing the survey, 91 (65%) were planning
to conceive (PTC), and 66 (47%) had experienced pregnancy
(EP) within the last 5 years. Prescribed systemic medications were
Poster abstracts 57
Acta Derm Venereol 2018
being used by 40% of pts PTC and 12% of pts who had EP. Only
41% pts who had EP informed the healthcare provider (HCP)
treating their PS of their pregnancy right away, while 21% did
not notify them at all.
While PTC, most pts who had not EP (88%), sought FP advice from
the internet; only 21% had consulted the HCP treating their PS,
compared to 55% of pts who had EP. Of the 96 pts who discussed
FP with the HCP treating their PS, just 7% said this was initiated by
the HCP. Pts PTC were most influenced by their personal network
(e.g. family), but of pts who had EP, 41% said the HCP treating
their PS was one of the most influential types of support in their
FP decisions. Pts reported wanting information on the impact of
PS and treatments on their baby, the heritability of PS, and flare
management during pregnancy. During pregnancy, 65% pts who
had EP stopped treatment (of any type), 79% of whom did so out
of fear of harming their baby. In 40% cases where pts had stopped
all and any treatment for PSO, the decision was initiated by the pt,
and in 47%, by their PS treatment provider. Of pts who stopped
treatment, 44% experienced a worsening in the severity of their
PS, yet most pts do/did not have a plan for flare management
during pregnancy (PTC: 69%; EP: 65%). Many pts stopping all
treatment had not been advised on restarting treatment post-partum
(PTC: 42%; EP: 23%).
Conclusions: Many WoCP with PS take systemic medications but
many do not discuss FP with their PS treatment provider, and if
they do, the discussion is rarely initiated by the HCP. PS treatment
providers should prioritize discussing FP, and plan treatment
around and during pregnancy. The educational needs of WoCP
with PS include the impact of treatment on their baby, flare management
during pregnancy, and restarting treatment post-partum.

THE PSYCHOSOCIAL IMPACT OF PSORIASIS:
DIFFERENTIAL EXPERIENCES OF MEN AND WOMEN
IN EARLY ADULTHOOD

Introduction: Plaque psoriasis (PSO) can have a profound impact
on patients’ (pts’) psychosocial wellbeing, leading to selfconsciousness,
embarrassment, depression, social isolation and
stigmatization. However, little is known of how the impact of
disease differs between genders.
Objective:To evaluate differences in the psychosocial impact of
PSO on quality of life in men and women in early adulthood.
Methods: Pts aged ≥18 in the US, Canada, France, Germany and
Italy without a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis were invited to
complete a postal survey (Oct 2016–Jan 2017), in the ratio 3:1
as being treated with advanced therapy (biologic/apremilast),
or eligible for but not yet receiving advanced therapy. Answers
were given on 5- or 7-point Likert Scale. Percentages shown are
proportions of pts responding using either of the two responses
indicating greatest impact of disease. Data are presented for pts in
early adulthood (18–45 years),[1] stratified by gender.
Results: 63 women and 73 men completed the survey; mean age
was 35 and 36 years, respectively, mean age at diagnosis was 28 for
both genders. Disease distribution was similar between genders,
although women reported more severe disease affecting their arms
and males reported more severe scalp disease. Whilst physical
impacts of disease were similar ( ≤ 2 pts reported severe problems
with walking, washing/dressing, carrying out housework/family/
leisure activities or daily work), a higher proportion of women
(14% vs 4%) reported severe/extreme pain or discomfort. Both
genders were more concerned by appearance (women: 73%, men:
63%) than pain (women: 43%, men: 34%).
A higher proportion of women than men were concerned by their
appearance (73% vs 63%), reported a greater impact on their
choice of clothing (37% vs 21%), and always/usually tried to
cover their skin (27% vs 16%). Similarly, psychosocial effects of
disease tended to be greater in women: 16% women vs 8% men
reported severe/extreme anxiety or depression; 29% women vs
18% men suffered sexually/in achieving intimacy. Similar proportions
had suffered at work (women: 11%, men: 16%), while
a higher proportion of women (6%) than men (3%) struggled to
live their lives as they did prior to their diagnosis. These findings
have been corroborated by ethnography studies.
Conclusion: Despite similar clinical manifestations of PSO,
women in early adulthood tended to report a greater impact of
their disease on their lives, both physically, in terms of pain, and
psychosocially, in terms of effects on relationships and impact on
their daily lives. Physician awareness of such gender differences
in the impact of the disease on patients’ lives would encourage
a more holistic approach to discussing treatment options with
their patients.

Introduction: Certolizumab pegol (CZP) is an Fc-free, PEGylated,
anti-TNF biologic. Here we present patient (pt)-reported quality of
life (QoL), work productivity and social activities over 48 weeks
of CZP treatment.
Materials/Methods: Data were pooled from CIMPASI-1
(NCT02326298) and CIMPASI-2 (NCT02326272) phase 3 trials
of adults with PSO ≥6 months (psoriasis area and severity index
[PASI] ≥12, affected body surface area [BSA] ≥10%, physician’s
global assessment [PGA] ≥3/5). Pts were randomized to CZP 400
mg every 2 weeks (Q2W), CZP 200 mg Q2W (following 400 mg
loading dose at Weeks 0, 2, 4), or placebo (PBO) Q2W for 16
weeks. Week 16 CZP-treated PASI 50 responders continued initial
blinded treatment to Week 48 (PBO-treated PASI 50 responders
are not included). PASI 50 non-responders at Weeks 32, 40 and
48 were discontinued.
Mean change from baseline (CFB) in Dermatology Life Quality
Index (DLQI), rates for DLQI minimally clinically important difference
(MCID; ≥4-point improvement) and DLQI remission (score
of 0/1), and CFB in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment
(WPAI) PSO-specific at Weeks 16 and 48 were assessed. Negative
CFB for DLQI and WPAI signifies improvement. CFB DLQI
analyses used last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation
for missing data, DLQI MCID and remission analyses used nonresponder
imputation, WPAI analyses used last observation carried
forward imputation at Week 16 and observed data at Week 48.
Results: At Week 16, CZP pts showed greater improvements in
DLQI vs PBO, and higher proportions achieved DLQI MCID and
DLQI remission (Table). Improvements were maintained to Week
48 in CZP-treated pts who continued treatment (Table). Improve58

ments in work productivity and reductions in activity impairment
were seen with both CZP doses vs PBO; and were maintained to
Week 48 in patients remaining in the trial. (Table).
Conclusions: Treatment with CZP was associated with improvements
in QoL, work productivity and social activities vs PBO at
Week 16, which was maintained to Week 48 in patients remaining
in the trials.

Introduction: The WHO resolution 2014 raised fundamental
demands for the health care system to increase the awareness for
patients with chronic skin diseases such as psoriasis, including its
fight against stigmatization. Single member states were encouraged
to take action on all levels, including public awareness campaigns.
After a period of refusal, the German ministry of health approved
a project submitted by German dermatologists, patient groups and
further experts to develop interventions against stigmatization.
Objectives- Aim of investigation: The project aims to develop and
evaluate public interventions against stigmatization of people with
visible skin diseases.
Methods: The project consist of three phases. Within a one-year
period current research will be processed through a systematic
literature search; recommendations for intervention formats will
be derived. The consecutive 18 months involve the development
of defined intervention formats. The interventions are supposed
to focus on locations of stigma and encounters of stigmatizing
with stigmatized persons.
Results: The application has been approved and is funded by the
German ministry of health for a period of three years throughout
the years 2018 to 2021. The project group consists of 25 dermatology-,
science- and patient-experts who work in operative
groups in order to develop the content and the intervention format.
In doing so, different levels of the stigmatization process,
namely stereotypes, prejudice, discrimination are considered as
important aspects and will be accounted for in the development
of the intervention. First results of the literature review imply that
people with visible skin disease such as psoriasis are affected by
stigmatization in several dimensions and strategies for reducing
the stigma are required.
Conclusion: Following the WHO resolution, this project is an example
for successful project initiation of an interdisciplinary team
to develop and implement an intervention against stigmatization.
First outcomes will be a comprehensive review of papers derived
from the systematic literature search in May 2018.

Dermatology Patient Organisations – IADPO, 3University of Cardiff
Introduction: The Global Research on the Impact of Dermatological
Diseases (GRIDD) project will be the first global patientinitiated
and patient-led impact research study in dermatology.
By including the patient perspective stringently into the burden
metrics, this will be the first program to systematically challenge
the current Global Burden of Disease concept, which markedly
underestimates the patient burden of skin diseases.
Objective:The objective of the GRIDD research project is to
develop a comprehensive measure of the impact of living with
skin diseases instruments by country, regionally and worldwide.
The global instrument, developed with patient organisations,
will capture patient experiences, including the extent of disease
impact and burden for patients and their families, for generic (i.e.
all dermatological diseases) and specific dermatological disease
including psoriasis assessment worldwide.
Materials + Methods: Development of the comprehensive measure
of impact of disease will be based on a novel methodology
with several phases. Phase 1 will systematically review existing
measures of the life impact of skin diseases and conduct a patientcentered
item identification exercise. Phase 2 will be informed by
Phase 1 data and will focus on instrument development: develop
the wording for items (i.e. impact categories) and appropriate
item scaling. This measure will describe the impact on life which
may include economic; psychological and social impacts. Phase
3 describes the acquisition of real world data to further test the
validity and acceptability of the new measure. Lastly, phase 4 and
5 include dissemination and launch of data, the new measure and
an implementation strategy to increase uptake of the measure.
Results: GRIDD has assembled a scientific advisory board representing
different regions worldwide. Currently, we are collaborating
with over 100 patient associations in 32 countries worldwide,
with more than 26 disease areas. Industry funding has been secured
from five different companies for the first phase and a portion of
phase 2. The GRIDD research team, including researcher from the
University Medical Center in Hamburg and University of Cardiff,
met in 2017 to start phases 1 and 2. The systematic literature review
on “Existing patient-centred outcome measures currently used in
dermatology” is currently underway.
Conclusion: This novel patient-centric methodology will complement
existing concepts of evaluating patient perspective in
dermatology. GRIDD will provide an extended patient view for
better decision making in dermatology on a global and country
level. It supports local, regional and international attempts to create
awareness, better position psoriasis and other skin diseases and
encourage decision-makers and stakeholders to include dermatological
diseases in their policies.

therapy opened new windows for treatment of nail psoriasis (1,2).
Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of
different pulse durations in the treatment of nail psoriasis with the
595-nm PDL to determine the optimal pulse duration.
Methods: In this clinical trial study, 120 patients with bilateral fingernail
psoriasis were evaluated. PDL was applied on the proximal
and lateral nailfolds based on random assignment. 240 nails were
treated with 6-millisecond pulse duration and 9 J/cm(2) whereas
240 nails were treated with 0.45-millisecond pulse duration and 6 J/
cm(2). Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) was used to assess the
clinical outcome from pretreatment and posttreatment photographs.
Results: After 6 months of first treatment, there was a significant
reduction in overall NAPSI, nail matrix NAPSI, and nail
bed NAPSI scores from baseline in both groups; however, no
significant difference was found between the two pulse duration
groups. Side effects were mild including transient petechiae and
hyperpigmentation.
Conclusion: PDL was found to be an effective and well-tolerated
option in the treatment of nail psoriasis. This study demonstrated
that both the longer 6-millisecond and shorter 0.45-millisecond
pulses of PDL (595 nm) have been clinically proven to be effective
for the treatment of nail matrix and nail bed psoriasis.

NEUTROPENIA IN A PSORIASIS PATIENT: SECUKINUMAB
OR MICRONUTRIENT DEFICIENCY?
Maruska Marovt, Katarina Trcko, Pij B. Marko
University Medical Centre Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia
We report a case of severe neutropenia in a psoriasis patient, which
developed three months after discontinuation of secukinumab. She
had gastric bypass surgery a few years ago and was intermittently
treated due to iron deficiency anemia. According to the suggested
approach to the adult with unexplained neutropenia (1) a range
of diagnostic tests were performed and no abnormalities were
noticed. Neutropenia still persists, however the patient hasn’t
had any complications. Neutropenia was reported infrequently in
subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis receiving secukinumab
in a pooled analysis of 10 phase II and III clinical studies (2). Most
were grades 1 or 2. Grade 3 neutropenia was uncommon and not
associated with serious infections, and no grade 4 neutropenia was
recorded. Deficiencies of dietary vitamins and minerals typically
cause neutropenia in association with other cytopenias. Patients
who have undergone bariatric surgery require lifelong vitamin
and mineral supplementation. Severe neutropenia in our patient
could be due to combination of secukinumab and micronutrient
deficiency, however exact etiology remains unclear.

ESTABLISHMENT OF A PSORIATIC SKIN MODEL FOR
Α-IRRADIATION

Introduction: Psoriasis is on the indication list for therapy in radon
galleries (1). Radon is a radioactive noble gas evaporating from
rocks. It is absorbed through skin or lung epithelium during inhalation.
Radon decays in the tissue under emission of α-particles.
The estimated dose received during a radon therapy is in the
order of 1.2 mSv which corresponds to the annual background
irradiation caused by radon. Chronic inflammatory diseases such
as rheumatoid arthritis are treated with radon and pain reduction
and improvement of mobility are reported (2). Positive effects
are also reported for psoriasis, but sparely documented. However,
for both diseases the mechanisms underlying the clinical benefit
are unknown.
Objectives: To investigate effects of radon treatment we have
established a cellular model for psoriasis which can be used for
irradiation with α-particles. The requirements in using α-particles
are specific due to their short range.
Methods: Special rings stringed with a 2 μm oxygen plasma
treated boPET foil are used to facilitate α-irradiation and growth
of NHEK (normal human epidermal keratinocytes). Cells were
cultured in rings or culture dishes for 24 hours and induced with
IL-17, IL-22 and TNF-α. Supernatants and cells for protein and
mRNA extraction were collected 24 hours after induction. ELISA,
qPCR and Western Blot analysis was performed.
Results: We could show that it is possible to culture primary
keratinocytes on plasma treated boPET foil with a similar morphology
to cells cultured in cell culture dishes. Furthermore, the
selected cytokines are able to significantly induce psoriasis-related
markers like IL-19 and BDEF2 on mRNA level and the release
of the cytokine IL-6. Testing if culturing of NHEK on the treated
boPET foil alone has an inflammatory effect revealed no significant
differences in the expression or release of markers compared to
cells cultured in cell culture dishes.
Conclusion: We conclude that the plasma treated boPET foil is a
promising tool for a setup, which enables α-irradiation of monolayer
cell cultures. The induction of a psoriasis-like phenotype with
cytokines leads to an enhancement of relevant markers.

THE HISTORY OF PSORIASIS
Selma Poparic
Dermatology Department University Clinical Center of Sarajevo
Many ancient texts, including the Bible, mention people afflicted
with diseases and symptoms very much like psoriasis. Ancient
Egyptians wrote about a salve made with various herbs that would
be spread on the skin, after which the afflicted person would be
instructed to sit in the sun to bring relief to symptoms that seem
to point to psoriasis. The Arabian physicians perhaps first distinguished
psoriasis from other skin diseases already in the 8th
century A.D., but the first written description of psoriasis appears
during the Roman Empire in the 1st century AD in the books of A.
Cornelius Celsus » De re medica libri octo». Galen (131–201 AD)
of Pergamon, physician of some Roman imperators, was the first
who used the term psoriasis, but only for an itchy, scaly eruption of
the eyelids and scrotum, that was probably seborrheic dermatitis.
Unfortunately, little was known about the origin of the disease for
hundreds of years, in the darkness of the Middle Age - a period of
stagnation, and many psoriasis sufferers were thought at the time
to have leprosy. Because so little was known about contraction
60

5th World Psoriasis & Psoriatic Arthritis Conference 2018
and treatment, psoriasis patients were often separated from the
general population for fear of them contaminating others. People
with psoriasis – thousands in medieval Europe – were forced to
warn others of their arrival by ringing a clapper.
It wasn’t until the early 1800’s that psoriasis was determined to
be a condition separate from leprosy. In the cultural movement of
Renaissance some authors mentioned the diseases psora and lepra
in their books. In the 18th century hospitals or dispensaries were
opened only for treatment of skin or venereal diseases giving to
the physicians the opportunity to study more cases of skin diseases
and psoriasis as well, while the end of the 19th century psoriatic
micro morphology was already described. In 20th century many
authors studied the genetic alteration, and today there is undisputed
evidence that the disease is multifactorial.
Psoriasis, as a common disease, has a significant socio-economic
impact on the individual and on the society. Last decades numerous
immunological researches accumulate evidence of presence of
alteration of the innate and adaptive immune response in psoriatic
patients. This imply a primary disregulation of the immune system
and permitts a better understanding and new insight in the pathogenesis
and as well new possibilities in the management of psoriasis.
This article shows a retrospective view of development of our
knowledge on psoriasis through history.

COMORBIDITIES AND TREATMENTS IN PATIENTS
WITH INVERSE PSORIASIS
Mia Schneeweiss, Joseph Merola
Brigham and Women’s Hospital
Introduction: Inverse (intertriginous) psoriasis is an underdiagnosed,
often untreated phenotype of psoriasis (PsO) with a high
burden of illness. Inverse PsO may occur in up to 23% of subjects
with psoriasis, higher than previously reported.
Objectives: To characterize the frequency of inverse PsO and
patient characteristics and their treatment in a large commercial
insurance claims database.
Methods: We used longitudinal claims data from commercially
insured patients in the US between 10/2015 and 12/2016 to identify
adults with a diagnosis of flexural psoriasis (ICD-10-CM: L40.8,
“other psoriasis” which is “recommended to be used for flexural
PsO”) associated with an outpatient or inpatient encounter. A 180-
day enrollment period was required before the first diagnosis of
AD. Among those diagnosed we computed the risk of initiating
immunomodulating medications during the following 6 months.
All analyses were conducted using the Aetion Evidence Platform.
Results: Of 1.5million patients with at least one code for PsO, after
excluding patients with concomitant other autoimmune conditions,
we identified 5,310 patients with an ICD-10 code of L40.8 used for
inverse PsO (4/1,000) with a median age of 52 years and an equal
gender distribution. Half of the patients were 41–60 years old.
Of those, 0.3% generalized pustular, 0.5% guttate, and 0.2%
pustulosis palmaris et plantaris. Prevalent comorbidities included
depression (7%), anxiety (6.5%), and cardiovascular conditions
(5%). 20% received antidepressants. Within 180 days after the
diagnosis of flexural PsO, 81% were using high-potency topical
corticosteroids, 66% phototherapy, 8.6% calcipotriene, 5.6% ustekinumab,
7.2% methotrexate, 7.3% adalimumab, 3.3% etanercept,
1.3% acitretin, 0.8% infliximab, 0.9% Cyclosporine, 0.1% Sulfasalazine,
0.02% topical tacrolimus, 0.5% topical pimecrolimus.
In patients 60+, 83% used high-potency topical corticosteroids,
7.8% phototherapy, 8.8% calcipotriene, 3.1% ustekinumab, 6.9%
methotrexate, 4.8% adalimumab, 2.9% etanercept, 1.5% acitretin,
0.5% infliximab, 0.9% Cyclosporine, 0.6% topical pimecrolimus.
Limitations: Although the ICD-10-CM code L40.8 is recommended
for flexural PsO, its sensitivity/specificity for validating cases
of flexural PsO has not been established, it may not encompass
all aspects of inverse/intertiginous disease and the code may be
highly underutilized.
Conclusions: Using the code ICD-10-CM L40.8, which is recommended
to be used for inverse “flexural” PsO leads to lower
prevalence estimates of inverse PsO than previously reported;
this underscores the known underreporting and underdiagnosis
of this condition. Among those patients diagnosed and coded,
most received topical corticosteroids and/or phototherapy, others
received calcipotriene, ustekinumab, methotrexate, adalimumab,
etanercept, and acitretin. Further work is needed to understand
how best to capture inverse (intertriginous) / flexural psoriasis
for clinical research work.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE “PSO SLEEPY-Q” AND
THE “PSA SLEEPY-Q”: TWO QUESTIONNAIRES
TO CHARACTERIZE SLEEP IN PATIENTS WITH
PSORIATIC DISEASE
Lourdes Perez-Chada
Harvard Medical School - Brigham and Women’s Hospital
Introduction: Substantial evidence suggests that psoriasis (PsO)
and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are independently associated with
sleep disturbance, which may result in serious health consequences
including cardiovascular events and mortality. However, the
validity of the sleep measures used in these studies is unknown
as they have not been validated in patients with psoriatic disease
or included psoriatic patients during their development process.
There is a need for validated disease-specific Patient-Reported
Outcome Measures (PROMs) to accurately characterize sleep in
this population and to measure the effect of psoriatic therapies on
sleep disturbance.
Objectives: This study aimed to develop and establish the content
validity of 2 new sleep PROMs: the “PsO Sleepy-Q” and the
“PsA Sleepy-Q”.
Methods: Following FDA PROM-development guidance, our
study: (i) hypothesized a conceptual framework and identified
domains through literature review and patient semi-structured
interviews using a saturation model (n = 30); (ii) rated domains
for importance by patients (n = 42) and an international expert
panel including dermatologists, rheumatologists and sleep experts
(n = 45); (iii) selected final domains based of the patients’ preference;
(iv) generated item pools and the preliminary versions of
the instruments.
Results: Psoriatic patients reported that sleep maintenance, adequacy,
quantity and quality were the most important aspects of
disordered sleep. Regarding causes of disturbed sleep: itch, skin
and joint pain, stiffness, taking care of psoriatic lesions before
bedtime, worsening of psoriatic symptoms at night, feeling uncomfortable
in bed due to PsA and sleep apneawere the most outstanding
factors selected. Finally, patients reported that disturbed
sleep may increase psoriatic signs and symptomsas well as fatigue,
cognitive impairment and psychological stress. Overall, patients
with PsA expressed a higher burden of sleep disturbance compared
to patients with PsO. Preliminary versions of the “PsO Sleepy-
Q” and “PsA Sleepy-Q” including 18 and 24 items, respectively,
were created. These questionnaires intend to measure the degree
of sleep disturbance, the potential causes of sleep disturbance and
the impairment related to sleep disturbance.
Conclusion: This study establishes the content validity of the “PsO
Sleepy-Q” and “PsA Sleepy-Q”, two patient-derived PROMs to
characterize sleep in patients with psoriatic disease in research
and clinical settings. These questionnaires will undergo cognitive
debriefing and further psychometric testing to define the final
instrument forms.

UNSTABLE FORMS OF PSORIASIS – INDICATOR OF AN
INTERMEDIATE STATE OF SYSTEMIC DISEASE
Florentina-Silvia Delli
State Hospital for Skin and Venereal Diseases - Hippokratia General Hospital,
Thessaloniki, Greece
Introduction: Erytrodermic psoriasis, inverse psoriasis and generalized
pustular psoriasis are considered three particular clinical
forms of psoriasis.
Objectives: We present two clinical cases in which it is discussed
the possibility of considering these clinical pictures as a manifestation
of the immunological switch of psoriasis from an organ-target
(skin or joint) disease, to a systemic form of psoriasis.
Methods: A 22-year-old-man with erythodermic psoriasis and a
history of inverse psoriasis since childhood was successfully treated
with 60 mg acitretin, until the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis at
the age of 26. The presence of arthritis determined us to change the
therapy. Secukinumab at the classic therapeutic scheme is keeping
the patient’s skin clean of psoriatic lesions, except from the armpits,
and without any arthritic symptoms. A 75-year-old-woman
with psoriatic arthritis and hyperkeratotic palms and soles nonspecific
lesions, under infliximab therapy presented generalized
pustular psoriasis. After 3 months of acitretin 40mg and etanercept
at the classic dose, the patient remains free of any symptoms.
Conclusions: The majority of psoriasis studies focus on chronic
plaque psoriasis. We sustain the opinion that the above unstable
forms of psoriasis, usually impossible to diagnose by other specialities
than Dermatology, should be consider the main step in
multidisciplinary approach of psoriasis as a systemic disease.

COULD BIOLOGICAL AGENTS FOSTER SUICIDE
THROUGH ITS POTENTIAL ANTIDEPRESSANT
MECHANISM? A PSYCHODERMATOLOGICAL
APPROACH
Estela M Malatesta
Dermatologist and Psychiatrist, Doctor. Arturo Ameghino Mental Health
Centre, Buenos Aires, Argentina. President of ADEPSI, Academy of Dermatology
and Psychiatry
Introduction: Depression and Psoriasis are associated in up to
60% of the cases, with an increased risk of attempted and completed
suicide in patients with severe forms of the disease. Bipolar
Disorder is a biological condition that affects between 2 and 5%
of the population, being an important cause of disability in the
world. In spite of this, Bipolar Disorder is often underdiagnosed as
Unipolar Depression, which increases the possibility of prescribing
errors, as it occurs when administering only antidepressant agents
without accompanying them with mood stabilizers, fostering the
appearance of episodes of inverse polarity (SWITCHING) which,
in turn, raises the risk of suicide.
Objectives: The “Cytokine Hypothesis” as a cause of depression
suggests the association between the immune system and depression
through the induction of the indolamine 2, 3- dioxygenase
enzyme. The objectives of the poster are:
• To raise the need for new studies to confirm this hypothesis as
well as the antidepressant effect of biological agents and their
potential ability to cause a shift into mania.
• To deepen the criteria for patient selection for both scientific and
therapeutic protocols.
Methods: This poster reviews the literature for evidence that while
biological agents could improve the mood of patients with psoriasis
treated with these drugs, this same favourable antidepressant effect
on humor may trigger a switch of mood into mania, favouring
attempted and completed suicide in undiagnosed bipolar patients
treated for psoriasis with IL17-TNF alpha cytokine blockers.
Results: Evidence gathered so far suggests that common inflammatory
processes could underpin both bipolar and psoriasis.
The current literature is lacking of longitudinal and mechanistic
studies, as well as comparison studies to explore the magnitude
of this relation.
Conclusion: Considering both bipolar disorder and psoriasis as a
multi-system disorder should help us understand the common physiopathology
of this comorbidity so as not to see them as separated
disorders. Consequently, it is vital to emphasize the importance of
the initial psychiatric evaluation for a correct psychiatric/ clinical
diagnosis for patients with Psoriasis to be both admitted to a strict
control protocol and treated with biological agents.

TREATING THE PAIN, NOT THE PROBLEM? RESULTS
FROM A SWEDISH ONLINE SURVEY ON PSORIATIC
ARTHRITIS AND PSORIASIS WITH JOINT PAIN
T Norgren, B Bohannan
Psoriasisförbundet, Stockholm, Sweden
Introduction: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory
disease associated with psoriasis, that can cause pain, swelling and,
if untreated, severe joint destruction and disability. The knowledge
about PsA among both the public and healthcare providers is limited,
leading to both underdiagnosis and undertreatment. To raise
awareness of PsA and gather relevant data, the Swedish Psoriasis
Association (Psoriasisförbundet) and the Swedish Rheumatism
Association (Reumatikerförbundet) initiated an educational
awareness campaign on a well-visited online health information
platform, which also featured a survey on healthcare experiences
and Quality of Life.
Objectives: The purpose of the survey was to identify gaps or
discrepancies in the healthcare provided for individuals diagnosed
with PsA and for individuals with psoriasis and joint pain consistent
with a PsA diagnosis, as well as understanding the impact on
QoL for both groups.
Methods: The survey consisted of two questionnaires, one for
individuals diagnosed with PsA, group A, and one for individuals
diagnosed with psoriasis who have joint pain consistent with
a PsA diagnosis (using CASPAR criteria as reference), group
B. The survey was open from April 6 2017 to March 31 2018.
The total number of respondents in group A was 5 201, and in
group B 11 272. It was not mandatory to answer all questions
in the survey. One section of the survey focussed on prescribed
medication, to specifically identify discrepancies in the treatment
of the diagnosed (A) and undiagnosed (B) groups. Limitations:
self-reported diagnosis, possible to take survey multiple times
using different devices.
Results: In response to the question “Which medication has been
prescribed for your joint pain during the past year?” 23.91% of
group B (214 of 895) answered that they had been prescribed
opioid pain medication for their joint pain. In group A only 4.61%
of the respondents (73 out of 1 582) were prescribed opioid pain
medication for their PsA.
Conclusions: The results show a large discrepancy between the
groups in the prescription of opioid pain medication. The results
suggest that individuals with psoriasis that have joint pain consistent
with a PsA diagnosis are being over-prescribed potentially
addictive pain medication rather than receiving treatment for their
underlying condition or inflammatory symptoms apart from pain.

5th World Psoriasis & Psoriatic Arthritis Conference 2018
As early diagnosis and effective treatment is vital to slow down
disease progression, individuals with psoriasis as well as healthcare
providers need to be educated on symptoms and diagnosis
criteria of PsA to prevent undertreatment or treatment that may
even be harmful.

AN INTERNATIONAL DELPHI SURVEY TO DEFINE
SCREENING FOR PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS AND
MEASUREMENT OF PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS
SYMPTOMS IN PSORIASIS CLINICAL TRIALS
Lourdes Perez Chada
Harvard Medical School-Brigham and Women’s Hospital
Introduction: The International Dermatology Outcome Measures
(IDEOM) group was established to standardize patient-centered
outcome measures to improve the assessment of treatment response
and disease course in dermatology. To define the measurement
set for psoriasis, IDEOM has initially defined a set of domains to
be measured in all psoriasis clinical trials representing a “Core Domain
Set”. “Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) Symptoms” is part of this set.
Objectives: To achieve consensus on whether patients enrolling
in a psoriasis clinical trial should first be screened for PsA and
then with which measure their PsA symptoms should be assessed.
Methods: Following the OMERACT (Outcome Measures in
Rheumatology) Filter 2.0, the COSMIN guidelines, and based
upon the feedback from a consensus meeting held at the IDEOM
2017 Annual Meeting, we conducted an international, multidisciplinary
and multi-stakeholder on-line Delphi survey. The survey
was organized into 3 parts in which participants were asked to
(1) vote on the role of PsA screening in psoriasis trials, (2) vote
on the quality (measurement properties) of 4 patient-reported
instruments: Patient Global (PG)-arthritis associated to a pain
assessment tool, PG-Psoriatic Arthritis (PG-PsA) associated to a
pain assessment tool, Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data-3
(RAPID3), and Psoriatic Arthritis Impact of Disease 9 (PsAID9),
and (3) rank these instruments in order of importance. Additionally,
respondents were invited to provide feedback on the survey.
Results: A total of n = 293, n = 233 and n = 218 subjects completed
the PsA screening, instrument quality assessment, and ranking
sections of the survey, respectively. The group was comprised of
rheumatologists (44.5%), dermatologists (26%), patients (7.5%),
industry partners (8.9%), dermatologist-rheumatologists (5.1%),
and patient association representatives (3.4%). Results showed that
90%of participants agreed that all patients enrolling in a psoriasis
trial should be screened for PsA. Regarding the quality of the
instruments, only the PsAID9reached the pre-specified endpoint
of > 70% with agreement that the instrument has good-to-excellent
validity, feasibility, reliability and responsiveness; < 15% agreed
that the quality of the instrument is poor or that there is not enough
information to make an informed decision. In the ranking exercise,
PsAID9 was the first choice(voted by 48% of respondents) and
RAPID3 represented an acceptable alternative second choice
(voted by 33% of respondents).
Conclusion: In this Delphi study, most participants agreed that all
psoriasis trial participants should be screened for PsA. Regarding
the measurement set for “PsA Symptoms”, PsAID9 was selected
as the most appropriate measure, while RAPID3 could be an acceptable
alternative to PsAID9. This will be followed by a workshop
at the IDEOM and GRAPPA 2018 annual meetings to review
discussion points as well as any need for a second Delphi round.

THE IMPACT OF A DIAGNOSIS ON THE PATIENTS’
PERCEPTION OF TREATMENT AND CARE. RESULTS
FROM AN ONLINE SURVEY ON PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS
AND PSORIASIS WITH JOINT PAIN
T Norgren, B Bohannan

Introduction: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory
joint disease that, if untreated, can cause joint destruction and disability.
The knowledge about PsA among both public and healthcare
providers is limited, leading to underdiagnosis and undertreatment.
To raise awareness of PsA and gather relevant data, the Swedish
Psoriasis Association and the Swedish Rheumatism Association
initiated a web-based educational campaign which also featured
a survey on healthcare experiences and Quality of Life.
Objectives: The purpose of the survey was to identify the gaps in
the healthcare provided for individuals diagnosed with PsA and
individuals with psoriasis and joint pain consistent with a PsA diagnosis,
as well as understanding the impact on QoL for both groups.
Method: The survey consisted of two questionnaires, one for
individuals diagnosed with PsA, group A, and one for individuals
diagnosed with psoriasis who have joint pain consistent with a PsA
diagnosis (using CASPAR criteria), group B. The survey was open
from April 6 2017 to March 31 2018. One section of the survey
focussed on time to diagnosis and perception of healthcare. Limitations:
self-reported diagnosis, possible to take survey multiple
times using different devices.
Results: Both groups had seen multiple doctors for their joint
pain. In group A 60% (n = 1 132) had seen > 4 doctors, with 11%
reporting having seen > 10. In group B 52.5% (n = 824) had
seen > 4 doctors, with 8% having seen > 10. In group A nearly
51% (n = 1 211) reported having had joint pain/symptoms for at
least 1 year before receiving a diagnosis, with 12% waiting > 10
years. In group B 91% (n = 1 872) reported having had joint pain/
symptoms for at least 1 year, with 35% at > 10 years.
Perception of healthcare differed greatly between the groups. In
group A over half (n = 1 273) reported that their perception of
healthcare improved or improved greatly after receiving their
PsA diagnosis. In group B nearly 78% (n = 1 227) reported being
dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the care they receive.
Conclusions: The results show that the group with a PsA diagnosis
have a much more positive perception of the treatment and care
they receive than the group without a diagnosis. Interestingly, in
another part of the survey group B reported their psoriasis having a
low to medium impact on their lives, indicating that their psoriasis
may be mild enough to be treated in a primary care setting only.
In the past few years there have been extensive efforts put into
educating Swedish dermatologists on recognizing early signs of
PsA, but steps should also be taken to raise awareness of psoriasisassociated
joint pain among general practitioners to ensure timely
referral to specialist care.
